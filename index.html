                    is partnering with truckload carrier C.R. England to
                    autonomously ship Tyson Foods products between Dallas and
                    San Antonio, Texas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A human safety operator will be present in the one dedicated
                    truck Kodiak is allocating to this pilot. Deliveries will
                    begin this month, according to the company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The pilot program is the latest in Kodiak's growing string
                    of paid partnerships with major carriers, and it further
                    demonstrates the startup's potential path to sustainability
                    and even profitability once it removes the human safety
                    driver from operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A spokesperson for Kodiak said the company aims to remove
                    the safety operator within the next couple of years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Kodiak says the partnership is not only emblematic of
                    how human-driven trucks and autonomous trucks can work
                    together, but it also provides a use case for autonomy as a
                    solution for moving perishable products in a timely manner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As part of the partnership, C.R. England is also
                    joining Kodiak's Partner Development Program, which is
                    Kodiak's way of working with carriers to help establish
                    autonomous freight operations and, hopefully, integrate
                    Kodiak's self-driving system into their fleet.
                  </p>

                    "Our intent is to be a 'one-stop shop' for customers,
                    whether they need their freight moved autonomously or not,"
                    said England.

                    To get good output from ChatGPT or another LLM, you usually
                    have to feed it several prompts. But what if you could just
                    give your AI bot a set of fairly broad goals at the start of
                    a session and then sit back while it generates its own set
                    of tasks to fulfill those goals? That's the idea behind
                    Auto-GPT, a new open-source tool that uses the OpenAI API
                    (same LLM as ChatGPT) to prompt itself, based on your
                    initial input.

                  <p>
                    We've already seen a number of Twitter users talk about how
                    they are using Auto-GPT for everything from creating
                    marketing plans to analyzing market data for investments to

                      >preparing topics for a podcast</a
                    >. Based on our hands-on experience, we can't say that it
                    always works well (we asked it to write a Windows 11 how-to
                    and the result was awful), but it's early days and some
                    tasks may work better than others.

                    If you want to try Auto-GPT on your computer, it is easy to
                    install, and while there are a few sticky points in the
                    process, we've found ways to work with them, or around them
                    to write this condensed guide on how to create your own
                    Auto-GPT AI to help you in your goals.

                    An animal bone fragment full of human-made pits hints at how
                    prehistoric people in Western Europe may have crafted
                    clothing.

                    They suggest that the bone fragment rested beneath animal
                    hide while an artisan pricked holes in the material,
                    possibly for seams. If so, it's the earliest-known tool of
                    its kind and predates eyed needles in the region by about
                    15,000 years.

                    Found at an archaeological site south of Barcelona, the
                    roughly 11-centimeter-long bone fragment contains 28
                    punctures scattered across one flat side, with 10 of them
                    aligned and fairly evenly spaced.

                    The marks don't seem to have been a notation system or
                    decoration, given that some holes are hard to see and the
                    bone fragment wasn't otherwise shaped, says archaeologist

                    thought leatherwork could have made the marks. But it wasn't
                    until he visited a cobbler shop and saw one of the artisan's
                    tools that the hypothesis solidified, guiding Doyon's next
                    steps.

                    Shargan Wangdue. "Ruminant animals could convert the energy
                    locked in alpine pastures into nutritional milk and meat,

                Europe. Temperatures there, averaged over the last 5 years, have
                increased by 2.2 degrees celsius.
              </p>
              <p>
                Europe, at least, has a climate change service to measure these
                things. As for the rest of the world, an extrapolation of the
                pattern shown in
                <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/esotc/2022/globe-in-2022"
                  >Figure 1c, here</a
                >, indicates that, there too, demand for swimming pools and
                flood insurance will grow.
              </p>
              <p>
                To illustrate the
                <a
                  href="https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/media-centre/news/2022/ecmwf-directors-talk-about-european-heatwaves"
                  >complexity</a
                >
                of the problem, the heatwave in mid-July of 2022 was caused by
                hot air from the Sahara moving into Europe, driving temperatures
                above 40 degrees Celsius. By mid-August, a stationary
                high-pressure system with clear skies and weak winds took hold,
                and caused a second heatwave, which was made worse due to the
                soil being dried out by the mid-July event, and no rains since.
              </p>
              <p>
                Events above the Sahara might have come a second time in play,
                here. Increasing temperatures lead to a stronger evaporation
                over sea, while the land heats up more. This results in a
                stronger temperature gradient, which draws rains deeper inland:
                heavier rainfalls now are reported in the central Sahara, in
                summer, with formerly dry valleys being put under four meters of
                water. This causes less Sahara dust in the atmosphere, and hence
                shields the land less from solar radiation: the EU's report
                mentions that 2022 surface solar radiation was the highest in a
                40 year record, and part of a positive trend.
              </p>
              <p>
                To end with a positive note, the EU ain't doing so bad, compared
                to Greenland: three different heatwaves in 2022, and an average
                September temperature more than 8 degrees Celsius higher than
                normal.

                    found an excess of positrons whose present-day energies
                    could correspond to a burst of activity from the galactic
                    center between 3 million and 10 million years ago, right
                    around when the Fermi bubbles are thought to have formed,

                    As of mid-August 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce's
                    Bureau of Industry and Security mandated that any company
                    planning to sell semiconductor hardware, software,
                    equipment, or any other asset using American intellectual
                    property to Huawei and its entities must obtain a special
                    export license. The export controls on Huawei mostly pertain
                    to semiconductors. However, Seagate's hard drives also fall
                    under the export-controlled items category because they use
                    controllers and memory designed with electronic design
                    automation tools developed by American companies and
                    produced using U.S.-made equipment.

                  <p>
                    These export licenses were subject to a presumption of
                    denial policy, meaning they were difficult to obtain.
                    However, multiple companies were granted appropriate
                    licenses between 2020 and 2022, which allowed Huawei to
                    acquire various products that were developed or manufactured
                    in the United States.

                    As it turned out, although Toshiba and Western Digital
                    ceased to sell HDDs to Huawei, Seagate continued to do so.
                    In fact, the company became Huawei's exclusive hard drive
                    supplier and even signed a three-year Strategic Cooperation
                    Agreement and then a Long-Term Agreement to purchase over
                    five million HDDs with the Chinese conglomerate in 2021.

                    [...] The paper's contributing authors include luminaries of
                    the AI world, such as Yoshua Bengio, MILA's scientific
                    director, who is a recipient of a 2019 Turing Award,
                    computing's equivalent of the Nobel Prize. Bengio is widely
                    credited with developing the attention mechanism long before
                    Vaswani and team adapted it for the Transformer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Also among the authors is Stanford University computer
                    science associate professor Christopher Ré, who has helped
                    in recent years to advance the notion of AI as

                  <p>
                    To find a sub-quadratic alternative to attention, Poli and
                    team set about studying how the attention mechanism is doing
                    what it does, to see if that work could be done more
                    efficiently.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A recent practice in AI science, known as mechanistic
                    interpretability, is yielding insights about what is going
                    on deep inside a neural network, inside the computational
                    "circuits" of attention. You can think of it as taking apart
                    software the way you would take apart a clock or a PC to see
                    its parts and figure out how it operates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One work cited by Poli and team is a set of experiments by
                    researcher Nelson Elhage of AI startup
                    <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>. Those
                    experiments take apart the Transformer programs
                    <a
                      href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html"
                      >to see what attention is doing</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In essence, what Elhage and team found is that attention
                    functions at its most basic level by very simple computer
                    operations, such as copying a word from recent input and
                    pasting it into the output.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, if one starts to type into a large language
                    model program such as ChatGPT a sentence from Harry Potter
                    and the Sorcerer's Stone, such as "Mr. Dursley was the
                    director of a firm called Grunnings...", just typing
                    "D-u-r-s", the start of the name, might be enough to prompt
                    the program to complete the name "Dursley" because it has
                    seen the name in a prior sentence of Sorcerer's Stone. The
                    system is able to copy from memory the record of the
                    characters "l-e-y" to autocomplete the sentence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the attention operation runs into the quadratic
                    complexity problem as the amount of words grows and grows.
                    More words require more of what are known as "weights" or
                    parameters, to run the attention operation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As the authors write: "The Transformer block is a powerful
                    tool for sequence modeling, but it is not without its
                    limitations. One of the most notable is the computational
                    cost, which grows rapidly as the length of the input
                    sequence increases."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the technical details of ChatGPT and GPT-4 haven't
                    been disclosed by OpenAI, it is believed they may have a
                    trillion or more such parameters. Running these parameters
                    requires more GPU chips from Nvidia, thus driving up the
                    compute cost.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To reduce that quadratic compute cost, Poli and team replace
                    the attention operation with what's called a "convolution",
                    which is one of the oldest operations in AI programs,
                    refined back in the 1980s. A convolution is just a filter
                    that can pick out items in data, be it the pixels in a
                    digital photo or the words in a sentence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Poli and team do a kind of mash-up: they take work done by
                    Stanford researcher Daniel Y. Fu and team to
                    <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=COZDy0WYGg"
                      >apply convolutional filters to sequences of words</a
                    >, and they combine that with work by scholar David Romero
                    and colleagues at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam that
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08059.pdf"
                      >lets the program change filter size on the fly</a
                    >. That ability to flexibly adapt cuts down on the number of
                    costly parameters, or, weights, the program needs to have.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The result of the mash-up is that a convolution can be
                    applied to an unlimited amount of text without requiring
                    more and more parameters in order to copy more and more
                    data. It's an "attention-free" approach, as the authors put
                    it.

                    Chinese social media, cloud, and entertainment giant Tencent
                    on Monday revealed that it has started mass production of a
                    home brew video transcoding accelerator.

                    a trio of custom chips designed to accelerate everything
                    from streaming video to networking and artificial

                    on WeChat, Tencent Cloud revealed that "tens of thousands"
                    of its Canghai chips, which are designed to offload video
                    encode/decode for latency sensitive workloads, have been
                    deployed internally to accelerate cloud gaming and live
                    broadcasting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tencent says the Canghai chip can be paired with GPUs from a
                    variety of vendors to support low-latency game streaming.
                    When used for video transcoding, Tencent said a single node
                    equipped with Canghai can deliver up to 1,024 video channels
                    . We'll note that Nvidia, with the launch of its L4 GPUs
                    last month, made similar

                    >. Without real-world benchmarks, it's hard to say how
                    either firm's claims stack up.

                  <p>
                    [...] When it comes to spinning custom chips to improve the
                    efficiency and economics of cloud computing, Amazon Web
                    Services gets a lot of credit. The American e-tail giant and
                    cloud titan has developed everything from custom CPUs, AI
                    training and inference accelerators, and smartNICs to
                    offload many housekeeping workloads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And while Google has developed an accelerator of its own,
                    called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), most US cloud
                    providers have largely stuck with commercially available
                    parts from the likes of Intel, AMD, Ampere, Broadcom, or
                    Nvidia, rather than designing their own.

                    However, in China, custom chips appear to be more prevalent,

                    Terran-R's design is focused on the reusability of its first
                    stage rather than its second stage, made from printed
                    aluminum that would allow up to 20 re-flights. The plan is
                    land the rockets on drone ships stationed in the Atlantic
                    Ocean, similar to how SpaceX lands its Falcon 9 first stage.

                    important for companies to move quickly or risk being left

                    the cochlear region of ears in all mammals. They sense sound
                    vibrations, convert those into brain signals, and eventually
                    allow a person to hear and understand the different sounds

                    Another former Meta worker who recounted a similar story is
                    35-year-old Britney Levy, who says she joined the company in
                    April 2022 but received her first and only assignment
                    shortly before being laid off in November. Since then,
                    companies across the tech industry, including Amazon, Meta,
                    Microsoft, Twitter, PayPal, Yahoo, Zoom, IBM, Spotify, and
                    others, have announced massive layoffs, affecting tens of

                    Talking to the WSJ, experts said they believe companies
                    overhired during the pandemic-era boom not because they
                    needed more workers, but to hoard talent from rival
                    companies. According to Vijay Govindarajan, professor at
                    Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, the hiring spree was
                    initially fueled by a shortage of tech talent but eventually
                    became a competition, which led to companies "hiring ahead
                    of demand." He also pointed out that that the situation was
                    very similar to what happened in the finance industry in the
                    early 2000s, when companies overhired during periods of high
                    growth, leaving many workers with not enough work.

                    Facebook and Google that are sitting on mammoth troves of
                    conversational data have not been clear about how personal

                    [...] ... another potential application of far side radio
                    astronomy is trying to detect radio waves from charged
                    particles trapped by magnetic fields—magnetospheres—of
                    planets orbiting other stars. This would help to assess how
                    capable these exoplanets are of hosting life. Radio waves
                    from exoplanet magnetospheres would probably have
                    wavelengths greater than 100m, so they would require a
                    radio-quiet environment in space. Again, the far side of the
                    Moon will be the best location.

                    The Moon also offers opportunities for other types of
                    astronomy as well. Astronomers have lots of experience with
                    optical and infrared telescopes operating in free space,
                    such as the Hubble telescope and JWST. However, the
                    stability of the lunar surface may confer advantages for
                    these types of instrument. Moreover, there are craters at
                    the lunar poles that receive no sunlight. Telescopes that
                    observe the universe at infrared wavelengths are very
                    sensitive to heat and therefore have to operate at low
                    temperatures. JWST, for example, needs a huge sunshield to
                    protect it from the sun's rays. On the Moon, a natural
                    crater rim could provide this shielding for free.

                    predictor for the US, our paid membership base is now larger
                    than prior to the launch of paid sharing and revenue growth

                    This rollout comes after paid sharing tests conducted in
                    Latin America in 2022 were rendered successful. Netflix
                    explains it saw initial cancel reactions in each of the
                    three countries it tested the paid sharing program when the
                    news were announced. But then it saw increased acquisition
                    and revenue as the "borrowers" activated their own paid
                    accounts and existing members began adding extra shared
                    accounts.

                    The European Union finally agreed on a new plan to boost its
                    microchip industry. The multi-billion investment is focused
                    on strengthening Europe's technological leadership, the EU
                    said, but it could very well be an attempt to put the Old
                    Continent on par with what market leaders are already doing
                    right now.

                    After spending some months negotiating between the European
                    Council and the European Parliament, the European Union has
                    now officially approved a plentiful subsidy plan for its
                    semiconductor industry. The

                    will put €43 billion (roughly $47 billion) to bolster
                    Europe's "competitiveness and resilience" in the microchip
                    business, promoting an effective digital and green

                    Right now, Europe has a 10% market share of global chip
                    manufacturing; with the EU Chips Act, Brussels plans to
                    double the EU's production capacity to 20% of the global
                    market by 2030.

                      >The plan</a
                    >
                    is also focused on strengthening Europe's research and
                    technology capabilities over chip advancements, building
                    innovation capacity in design manufacturing and packaging,
                    developing an in-depth understanding of the global
                    semiconductor supply chain, and addressing the skills
                    shortage by attracting new talents and growing its own
                    skilled workforce.

                    Microchips already are "strategic assets for key industrial
                    value chains," the EU said, while the digital transformation
                    opened new markets for the chip industry such as highly
                    automated cars, cloud, IOT, connectivity, space, defense and
                    supercomputers. The recent global semiconductor shortages
                    also showed how the global supply chain has an "extreme"
                    dependency on very few actors in a complex geopolitical
                    context.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As a matter of fact, the final EU Chips Act contains
                    some additional provisions which were not included in the
                    initial draft. Besides funding the manufacturing of
                    cutting-edge semiconductor technology, the plan will also
                    cover the entire value chain with older chips and research
                    &amp; design facilities. The EU Chips Act is coming after
                    the world's powerhouses in the chip industry (USA, Taiwan,
                    South Korea, Japan) have already approved or are in the
                    process of approving their own subsidy initiatives.
                    Therefore, Brussels' money to boost EU semiconductor output
                    won't guarantee success.

                Long story short this adds an 2D barcode to product labels
                alongside the existing 1D barcode. The 2D barcode gives extra
                info to the retailer (assuming the manufacturer adds it to the
                barcode) like batch/lot #, expiry date etc and can also provide
                a URL for the product to the consumer where they can find out
                more info about the product. There's even a complete fake brand
                set up to show off the concept -
                <a href="https://dalgiardino.com/">https://dalgiardino.com/</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                Since most POS apps are likely going to be confused by 2
                barcodes on 1 product and potentially double-charge you for your
                favourite box of cornflakes the scanner vendors are implementing
                a feature where they'll only send 1 barcode to the POS system;
                for legacy scanners that'll be the 1D barcode (like now), for
                new scanners that can read 2D barcodes it can either be specific
                GS1 tags or the entire barcode depending on what the POS
                application wants.

                Note that this is already live for some manufacturers and
                geographies, 2027 is just when it's intended to be deployed
                globally.

                    The relevance of a quiet aircraft to the DOD is likely
                    obvious. Whisper has validated that it can fly a 55-pound
                    drone with its electric-ducted fan at an altitude of 200
                    feet that is completely undetectable, at least by noise,
                    from the ground. To put that in context, Moore said Boeing's
                    popular military drone, the Insitu ScanEagle, would need to
                    fly at least 3,000 feet above to not be heard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's sort of a breakthrough in terms of what surveillance
                    drones are capable of doing in terms of missions, by being
                    able to get so close and not be detected," Moore said.
                    "Especially at night, where you won't be able to see it. It
                    can be flying and loitering right overhead and you would
                    have no idea that's there."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The company is quick to point out that the benefits
                    don't just lie in decreased noise, but also in the
                    efficiency gains – a metric that's all the more important as
                    more of the world's technologies switch to electric, and
                    must depend on the limited lifespan of batteries. The
                    company also says that many aircraft have speeds that are
                    limited by open rotors (or open propellors), as opposed to
                    ducted. Instead of operating at 150 miles per hour, an eVTOL
                    could potentially fly as fast as 300-400 miles per hour.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We are this future Pratt &amp; Whitney mashed up with
                    a Dyson," Moore said, referring to the giant aircraft engine
                    maker and the consumer tech company best known for its
                    vacuums and hair dryers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We're very anxious to take this technology to people's
                    everyday life."

                    says. "It could be totally legit or that could be really

                    [...] So how do you wipe a router that you want to retire?
                    The good news is most routers are fairly easy to securely
                    decommission, and the big three Cisco, Fortinet, and Juniper
                    on their websites provide detailed guidelines for restoring
                    devices to their factory default settings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] And if your organization already had disposed of
                    routers that weren't properly wiped, Eset recommends
                    rotating cryptographic keys in case an attacker were to get
                    their hands on your old router and attempt to gain trusted
                    access to your network. Zero trust can help here as well,
                    they say.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] If you buy a secondhand core router, and like the
                    researchers find that it still contains the previous owner's
                    information, Eset recommends disconnecting the router and
                    moving it to a secured area and contact your regional CISA
                    office. They also say it's best to document your purchase
                    process as a precaution for insurance or legal purposes.

                    A retired NASA spacecraft will reenter Earth's atmosphere on
                    Wednesday, with some parts of the vehicle expected to crash
                    to the planet's surface.

                    While most of the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar
                    Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) spacecraft is expected to burn
                    up as it enters the atmosphere at high speed, some parts of
                    the 660-pound (300-kilogram) machine are likely to survive
                    the descent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The good news is that
                    <a
                      href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-retired-solar-energy-imager-spacecraft-to-reenter-atmosphere"
                      >NASA says</a
                    >
                    that the risk of harm coming to folks on terra firma is low
                    at "approximately 1 in 2,467." Still, for anyone wishing to
                    don a hard hat just in case, RHESSI is expected to reenter
                    the atmosphere at about 9:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday, April 19,
                    though the forecast comes with an uncertainty of plus/minus
                    16 hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] RHESSI entered service in 2002 and, until its
                    retirement in 2018, it observed solar flares and coronal
                    mass ejections from its low-Earth orbit. Its work enabled
                    scientists to learn more about the underlying physics of how
                    these powerful bursts of energy occur.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The spacecraft's activities included imaging the high-energy
                    electrons that carry a large part of the energy released in
                    solar flares. Using its imaging spectrometer, RHESSI became
                    the first-ever mission to record gamma-ray images and
                    high-energy X-ray images of solar flares.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The mission also helped to improve measurements of the
                    sun's shape, and demonstrated that terrestrial gamma ray
                    flashes — described by NASA as "bursts of gamma rays emitted
                    from high in Earth's atmosphere" and which occur above some
                    thunderstorms — happen more frequently than first thought.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NASA said it retired RHESSI in 2018 after maintaining
                    communications with it became difficult. After retaining its
                    low-Earth orbit for the last five years, the spacecraft is
                    about to meet a fiery end.

                    NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter was designed to fly just

                    Flight 50 departed Airfield Lambda on April 13th and
                    required 145.7 seconds to reach Airfield Mu, a 322-meter
                    flight at a brisk 4.6 meters per second, cruising at a new

                    to eke out five flights," said Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity
                    team lead at JPL, in a blog post celebrating the 50th flight
                    . "We have exceeded our expected cumulative flight time
                    since our technology demonstration wrapped by 1,250 percent

                    The Ingenuity team is now planning a 51st flight to bring
                    the 'copter close to the "Fall River Pass" region of Jezero
                    Crater. Future flights will head towards "Mount Julian,"
                    from where the craft will enjoy panoramic views of the
                    nearby Belva Crater, an 800-metre dent in Mars' surface.

                    Between 2019 and 2020, data that Cybersixgill collected
                    reflected a massive surge in use of encrypted messaging
                    platforms, with the total number of collected items
                    increasing by 730%. In the firm's 2020-2021 analysis, this
                    number increased by 338%, and then just 23% in 2022 to some
                    1.9 billion items collected from messaging platforms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "When considering workflow activity, it's quicker and easier
                    to browse through channels on the messaging platforms rather
                    than needing to log in to various forums, and read through
                    posts, etc.," said Liggett.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Across the dark web onion sites, the total number of forum
                    posts and replies decreased by 13% between 2021 and 2022,
                    dropping from over 91.7 million to around 79.1 million. The
                    number of threat actors actively participating in top forums
                    also declined slightly, according to the report.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 10 largest cybercrime forums averaged 165,390 monthly
                    users in 2021, which dropped by 4% to 158,813 in 2022.
                    However, posts on those 10 sites grew by nearly 28%, meaning
                    the forums' participants became more active.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study said that, in the past, most threat actors
                    conducted their operations on the dark web alone, while in
                    recent years there's been migration to deep-web encrypted
                    messaging platforms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cybercriminals favor deep web platforms because of their
                    relative ease of use versus Tor, which requires more
                    technical skills. "Across easily-accessible platforms, chats
                    and channels, threat actors collaborate and communicate,
                    trading tools, stolen data and services in an illicit
                    network that operates in parallel to its dark web
                    equivalent," said the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "People tend to communicate in real-time across these
                    platforms," said Liggett. "Forums and marketplaces in the
                    dark web are notorious for not always having a high level of
                    uptime. They sometimes end up going offline after a period

                    The timing of MariaDB's flotation may have been unfortunate.
                    While it was already in train, the SPAC model was going out
                    of favor.

                    Speaking to <em>The Register</em>, MariaDB CMO Franz Aman
                    said the company was still hiring, but a number of job
                    losses had also been necessary. "It's absolutely no secret
                    that, like companies in tech, we need to be super prudent,
                    and we need to be fiscal responsive. We also had a look at
                    our headcount plan, and we had to make sure that we were
                    doing the right things. We had a reduction in workforce...
                    so have most other tech companies: everyone's concerned
                    about profitability, cash position."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Aman argued that a "going concern" notice in regulatory
                    filings was far from unusual.

                    (things are actually slightly more complicated than this -
                    your password is used to generate a key that is then used to
                    encrypt and decrypt the <em>actual</em> encryption key. This
                    is necessary in order to allow you to change your password
                    without having to re-encrypt the entire drive - instead you
                    simply re-encrypt the encryption key with the new
                    password-derived key. This also allows you to have multiple
                    passwords or unlock mechanisms per drive)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Good KDFs reduce this risk by being what's technically
                    referred to as "expensive". Rather than performing one
                    simple calculation to turn a password into a key, they
                    perform a <em>lot</em> of calculations. The number of
                    calculations performed is generally configurable, in order
                    to let you trade off between the amount of security (the
                    number of calculations you'll force an attacker to perform
                    when attempting to generate a key from a potential password)
                    and performance (the amount of time you're willing to wait
                    for your laptop to generate the key after you type in your
                    password so it can actually boot). But, obviously, this
                    tradeoff changes over time - defaults that made sense 10
                    years ago are not necessarily good defaults now. If you set
                    up your encrypted partition some time ago, the number of
                    calculations required may no longer be considered up to
                    scratch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And, well, some of these assumptions are kind of bad in the
                    first place! Just making things computationally expensive
                    doesn't help a lot if your adversary has the ability to test
                    a large number of passwords in parallel. GPUs are extremely
                    good at performing the sort of calculations that KDFs
                    generally use, so an attacker can "just" get a whole pile of
                    GPUs and throw them at the problem. KDFs that are
                    computationally expensive don't do a great deal to protect
                    against this. However, there's another axis of expense that
                    can be considered - memory. If the KDF algorithm requires a
                    significant amount of RAM, the degree to which it can be
                    performed in parallel on a GPU is massively reduced. A
                    Geforce 4090 may have 16,384 execution units, but if each
                    password attempt requires 1GB of RAM and the card only has
                    24GB on board, the attacker is restricted to running 24
                    attempts in parallel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, in these days of attackers with access to a pile of
                    GPUs, a purely computationally expensive KDF is just not a
                    good choice. And, unfortunately, the subject of this story
                    was almost certainly using one of those. Ubuntu 18.04 used
                    the LUKS1 header format, and the only KDF supported in this
                    format is
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a>.
                    This is not a memory expensive KDF, and so is vulnerable to
                    GPU-based attacks. But even so, systems using the LUKS2
                    header format used to default to
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2">argon2i</a>,
                    again not a memory expensive KDF. New versions default to
                    argon2id, which is. You want to be using argon2id.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What makes this worse is that distributions generally don't
                    update this in any way. If you installed your system and it
                    gave you pbkdf2 as your KDF, you're probably still using
                    pbkdf2 even if you've upgraded to a system that would use
                    argon2id on a fresh install. Thankfully, this can all be
                    fixed-up in place. But note that if anything goes wrong here
                    you could lose access to all your encrypted data, so before
                    doing anything make sure it's all backed up (and figure out
                    how to keep said backup secure so you don't just have your
                    data seized that way).

                    However, the language as it stands has prompted concerns
                    from the open source world. While the text does seem to
                    exempt non-commercial open source software from its scope,
                    trying to define what is meant by "non-commercial" is not a
                    straight forward endeavor. As GitHub policy director Mike

                    temporary but indefinite basis after completing its
                    acquisition of the social network from Parlement
                    Technologies. The buyer says it will conduct a "strategic
                    assessment" of the platform during the downtime, and hopes
                    to integrate Parler's audience into all its existing

                    Starboard isn't shy about its strategy. While it still sees
                    a market for communities that believe they've been censored
                    or marginalized, it considers a Parler revamp virtually
                    necessary. "No reasonable person believes that a Twitter
                    clone just for conservatives is a viable business any more,"
                    the company says.

                    within five years if residents continue their current rate
                    of "unsustainable" water consumption.

                  <p>
                    The good news is Utahans still have time to halt or even
                    reverse the Great Salt Lake's decline by using less water.
                    Cutting agricultural and other outdoor water use by a third
                    to half through a combination of voluntary conservation
                    measures and policy changes would allow the lake to refill
                    enough to support the region's economy, ecology and quality
                    of life, the report says. If Utahans succeed, the Great Salt
                    Lake can be a model for how to save other saline lakes
                    around the world.

                    The folks at Peto's Travel Center and Casino in Roanoke,
                    Louisiana see all kinds of vehicles pull up, but Tuesday
                    night was different. What ended up in their parking lot is
                    certainly something of a mystery, to say the least.

                    Someone left a Russian T-90A tank, which open source
                    intelligence (OSINT) trackers say was captured by Ukraine
                    last fall, on a trailer after the truck hauling it broke
                    down and pulled into this truck stop off U.S. Interstate 10.
                    An employee at Peto's, and the individual who first posted
                    the images on Reddit, shared them with The War Zone.

                    In March, <em>Tristan Harris</em>, Co-Founder of the Center
                    for Humane Technology, invited leaders to a lecture on how
                    AI could wipe out humanity. To begin his doomsday
                    presentation, he stated: "What nukes are to the physical
                    world ... AI is to everything else."

                    [...] To further escalate the AI panic,
                    <em>Tristan Harris</em>published an OpEd in
                    <em>The New York Times</em> with
                    <em>Yuval Noah Harari</em> and <em>Aza Raskin</em>. Among
                    their overdramatic claims: "We have summoned an alien
                    intelligence," "A.I. could rapidly eat the whole human
                    culture," and AI's "godlike powers" will "master us."

                  <p>
                    [...] "This is what happens when you bring together two of
                    the worst thinkers on new technologies," added
                    <em>Lee Vinsel</em>. "Among other shared tendencies,

                    However, that advice is little help to cities with existing
                    pipeline infrastructure. In these systems, the focus must be
                    on minimizing the potential damage by reducing the height of
                    the geysers, the volume of expelled water, or the resulting
                    damage to the pipeline.

                    increasing the maintenance hole diameter, using expansion
                    segments in maintenance holes, installing orifice plates,
                    and adding structures to allow air release while preventing
                    the outflow of water," said Zhang. "However, these measures

                    NASA is clearly unable to install new hardware equipment on
                    Curiosity, but the latest software update makes image
                    processing faster so that the rover needs to stop "for just
                    a moment or two" instead of the full minute needed before.
                    This way, Curiosity will consume less energy and extend its
                    mission even further.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second major improvement brought by the R13 update is
                    for the rover's aluminum wheels, which started to show signs
                    of wear within the mission's first year. The patches
                    installed before provided the rover with an algorithm to
                    improve traction, now R13 "goes further" in that direction
                    by introducing "two new mobility commands" that can reduce
                    the amount of steering Curiosity needs to do "while driving
                    in an arc toward a specific waypoint," NASA said. The
                    driving process will be simpler, thus wear should be further
                    reduced.

                    There's some controversy in the photography world as an
                    AI-generated image won a major prize at a prestigious
                    competition,

                    <a href="https://www.eldagsen.com/pseudomnesia/"
                      ><em>The Electrician</em></a

                    by Boris Eldagsen took first prize in the Creative category
                    at the World Photography Organization's Sony World
                    Photography Awards — despite not being taken by a camera.
                    Eldagsen subsequently refused the award, saying "AI is not
                    photography. I applied [...] to find out if the competitions
                    are prepared for AI images to enter. They are not."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eldagsen's image is part of a series called
                    <em>PSEUDOMNESIA: Fake Memories</em>, designed to evoke a
                    photographic style of the 1940s. However, they are in
                    reality "fake memories of a past, that never existed, that
                    no one photographed. These images were imagined by language
                    and re-edited more between 20 to 40 times through AI image
                    generators, combining 'inpainting', 'outpainting', and
                    'prompt whispering' techniques."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a blog, Eldagsen explained that he used his experience as
                    a photographer to create the prize-winning image, acting as
                    a director of the process with the AI generators as
                    "co-creators." Although the work is inspired by photography,
                    he said that the point of the submission is that it is
                    <em>not</em> photography. "Participating in open calls, I
                    want to speed up the process of the Award organizers to
                    become aware of this difference and create separate
                    competitions for AI-generated images," he said.

                  <p>
                    Eldagsen subsequently declined the prize. "Thank you for
                    selecting my image and making this a historic moment, as it
                    is the first AI-generated image to win in a prestigious
                    international photography competition," he

                    generated? Something about this doesn't feel right, does it?
                    AI images and photography should not compete with each other
                    in an award like this. They are different entities. AI is
                    not photography. Therefore I will not accept the award.

                When does the processing of a 'photograph' become unacceptable?
                Techniques such as burning and dodging, plus various types of
                film processing, can all change the image that is finally
                produced. Digital photographs can be even more easily modified.
                At what point does it become an entirely new genre. Does the
                method of production really matter? [JR]

                    In Switzerland, one in three employees suffers from
                    workplace stress. Those affected often don't realise that
                    their physical and mental resources are dwindling until it's
                    too late. This makes it all the more important to identify
                    work-related stress as early as possible where it arises: in
                    the workplace.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers at ETH Zurich are now taking a crucial step in
                    this direction. Using new data and machine learning, they
                    have developed a model that can tell how stressed we are
                    just from the way we type and use our mouse.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And there's more: "How we type on our keyboard and move our
                    mouse seems to be a better predictor of how stressed we feel
                    in an office environment than our heart rate," explains
                    study author Mara Nägelin, a mathematician who conducts
                    research at the Chair of Technology Marketing and the
                    Mobiliar Lab for Analytics at ETH Zurich. Applied correctly,
                    these findings could be used in future to prevent increased
                    stress in the workplace early on.

                    [...] The researchers are currently testing their model with
                    data from Swiss employees who have agreed to have their
                    mouse and keyboard behaviour as well as their heart data
                    recorded directly at their workplace using an app. The same
                    app also regularly asks the employees about their subjective
                    stress levels. Results should be available by the end of the
                    year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, workplace stress detection also raises some thorny
                    issues: "The only way people will accept and use our
                    technology is if we can guarantee that we will anonymise and
                    protect their data. We want to help workers to identify
                    stress early, not create a monitoring tool for companies,"
                    Kerr says. In another study involving employees and
                    ethicists, the researchers are investigating which features
                    an app needs to have to meet these requirements and ensure
                    responsible handling of sensitive data.

                    As the world wakes up to exactly what a Tesla's onboard
                    cameras can capture and beam back to their makers, a wider

                    Systems such as telematics black boxes that record a
                    vehicle's location and how it is driven are commonplace
                    today. Complaints about how that data is fed back to Big
                    Brother seem old-fashioned.

                  <p>
                    From Tesla's Model Y to the humble Mini, around two million
                    of these data-gathering cars have been registered in the UK
                    over the past five years.

                The question is, when will it be impossible to buy a car that
                can't spy on you.

                    "It's logical that if the scale of the investment is

                    The EELS initiative comes in the backdrop of discoveries
                    made by the Cassini probe, which explored Saturn, its rings,
                    and moons for nearly 13 years. The iconic mission ended in
                    September 2017 when the spacecraft crashed into Saturn's
                    atmosphere.

                    The remarkable discovery of plumes of water vapor ejected
                    into space by Saturn's tiny icy moon Enceladus prompted the
                    development of this EELS snake robot. This raised the
                    possibility of a habitable liquid ocean beneath the moon's
                    frozen crust and piqued the space community's interest in
                    exploring this moon.

                    Retroviruses have the nifty trick of slipping a copy of
                    their genetic instructions inside our own.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, chaos dominates inside a cancerous cell when it is
                    growing uncontrollably and the once tight control of these
                    ancient viruses is lost.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These ancient genetic instructions are no longer able to
                    resurrect whole viruses but they can create fragments of
                    viruses that are enough for the immune system to spot a
                    viral threat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The immune system is tricked into believing that the tumour
                    cells are infected and it tries to eliminate the virus, so
                    it's sort of an alarm system," Prof George Kassiotis, head
                    of retroviral immunology at the biomedical research centre,
                    told me.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The antibodies summon other parts of the immune system that
                    kill off the "infected" cells - the immune system is trying
                    to stop a virus but in this case is taking out cancerous
                    cells.

                    after the vote, the LIBE committee rapporteur Juan Fernando
                    López Aguilar said:

                        The new framework is certainly an improvement compared
                        to previous mechanisms. However, we are not there yet.
                        We are not convinced that this new framework
                        sufficiently protects personal data of our citizens, and
                        therefore we doubt it will survive the test of the CJEU.
                        The Commission must continue working to address the
                        concerns raised by the European Data Protection Board

                    The Starship Orbital Flight Test is the planned first
                    spaceflight of the SpaceX Starship launch vehicle. The
                    planned launch site is Boca Chica, Texas. SpaceX plans on
                    using Starship prototypes Ship 24 (second stage) and Booster
                    7 (first stage). The Starship second stage will enter a
                    transatmospheric Earth orbit with a negative Earth perigee,
                    allowing Ship 24 to reenter the atmosphere after completing
                    most of one orbit without having to restart its engines for
                    a deorbit maneuver. The earliest launch opportunity is
                    currently scheduled for April 17, 2023 at 08:00 CDT (13:00
                    UTC).

                    To improve security, the cybersecurity industry needs to
                    follow the aviation industry's shift from a blame culture to
                    a "just" culture, according to director of the Information
                    Systems Audit and Control Association Serge Christiaans.
                  </p>

                    Speaking at Singapore's
                    <a

                    >
                    this week, Christiaans explained that until around 1990, the
                    number of fatal commercial jet accidents was
                    <a
                      href="https://accidentstats.airbus.com/statistics/fatal-accidents"
                      >growing</a
                    >
                    alongside a steady increase of commercial flights. But
                    around the turn of the decade, the number of flights
                    continued to rise while the number of fatalities began to
                    drop.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While acknowledging that improved technology, more
                    mature processes and improved leadership all helped to
                    improve aviation safety, the former pilot and field CISO at
                    tech consultancy Sopra Steria said the biggest improvements
                    came from a change to a "just culture" that accepts people
                    will make mistakes and by doing so makes it more likely
                    errors will be reported.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a just culture, errors are viewed as learning
                    opportunities instead of moral failing, creating
                    transparency and enabling constant improvement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Christiaans said he is yet to come across a company
                    that had implemented open reporting without punishment in
                    cybersecurity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He attributed this to the industry working from the top
                    down. The people at the top worked hard to get to leadership
                    roles and become resistant to change. Shifting culture
                    therefore needs to start with new recruits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Furthermore, not all of the aviation industry has been
                    a beacon of transparent culture. For example, whistleblowers
                    have
                    <a
                      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/business/boeing-737-max-crashes.html"
                      >alleged</a
                    >
                    that culture at Boeing emphasized profit over safety,
                    ultimately leading to engineering decisions that caused the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/15/boeing_737_max_senate_report/"

                    of two 737 MAX airplanes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But Christiaan's analysis may be true at least when it
                    comes to pilots and airlines, especially when culture is
                    changed with small steps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "So you plant the seeds, some airlines adapt, some don't,"
                    said Christiaans. "The ones who adapt, succeed."

                    [...] NovoNutrients relies on bacteria to do the dirty work.
                    The company has surveyed the scientific literature to find
                    species that can use carbon dioxide in their metabolic
                    pathways, allowing them to use the waste gas as energy. Its
                    scientists have also discovered strains not otherwise known
                    to science.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our technology is about how do you industrialize this
                    naturally occurring metabolism?" CEO David Tze told
                    TechCrunch+.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The company's approach has several advantages over
                    other methods of using carbon dioxide. For one thing, it
                    does not require large amounts of land or water, which are
                    both in short supply in many parts of the world. It also
                    does not require the use of fossil fuels, which are a major
                    contributor to climate change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NovoNutrients is not the only company working on using
                    carbon dioxide to create protein. Other companies, such as
                    Calysta and Deep Branch Biotechnology, are also developing
                    similar technologies. However, NovoNutrients believes that
                    its approach is unique because it uses bacteria to create
                    protein products that are high in quality and can be sold at
                    a competitive price.

                    The company's pilot-scale plant will be located in
                    California and is expected to be operational by the end of
                    2021 [sic]. If successful, NovoNutrients plans to build a
                    larger commercial-scale plant that could produce up to 1,000
                    metric tons of protein per year.

                  <p>
                    Despite criticism by UN members, she said, "by April 2022,
                    many democratic countries that had strongly opposed the
                    draft treaty were actively engaging in the negotiations and
                    pursuing compromise through amendments."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What concerns Rodriguez and other representatives of
                    advocacy groups at the briefing is that the treaty
                    negotiators will compromise on surveillance, privacy, and
                    human rights.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Part of the problem lies in the vague language of the
                    proposed chapters. Rodriguez cited the chapters on
                    international cooperation, which could open the door to bulk
                    data sharing rather than investigations related to specific
                    evidence. Another problem, she said, is the dual criminality
                    provision which could bring state authorities into
                    investigating activities that they do not consider crimes in
                    their own country.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Unfortunately, instead of progressing towards a human
                    rights-based approach in the negotiation of the treaty, as
                    of now, the current draft is moving away from them," said
                    Rodriguez. "Countries such as India, Russia, China, Iran,
                    Syria, Egypt, and Tonga have even proposed to delete
                    references to international human rights obligations."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another problematic section, she said, endorses "special
                    investigative techniques." It would make any form of
                    surveillance acceptable, whether it exists currently, like
                    facial recognition, or has yet to be developed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This provision also has a very problematic clause, which
                    allows the removal or replacement of data being transmitted
                    over networks," said Rodriguez.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Barbora Bukovská, senior director for law and policy with
                    ARTICLE 19, a UK-based human rights organization, said many
                    of the proposed new crimes are speech-based offenses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Those are offenses when you're punished for speaking or
                    doing something online, because this peripherally involves
                    using computer or digital technology," said Bukovská. "And
                    there are extremely vague and overbroad provisions which the
                    states would have to then replicate their national
                    legislation."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One consequence of this, she said, would be to restrict
                    freedom of expression.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It should be a concern to journalists, human rights
                    defenders, and activists in general because you might be
                    prosecuted under these provisions if adopted in national
                    legislation," she said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "It must be ensured that government hacking must not
                    be justified in any way," said Fachathaler. "Government
                    hacking is unlike any other form of existing surveillance
                    techniques. It is far more intrusive. It permits remote and
                    secret access to personal devices and data stored on them.
                    It can conduct various forms of real time surveillance. It
                    can manipulate data on devices without leaving any trace."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fachathaler said the current proposals also lack any remedy
                    for privacy violations and any power to audit investigations
                    to ensure compliance with applicable law.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We're not against more modern law enforcement techniques
                    because we understand modern law enforcement in response to
                    new developments in this field of cybercrime is of course
                    important and necessary," she said. "But the present draft
                    goes far beyond that simple goal."

                    Intel introduced the 8086 microprocessor in 1978, and its
                    influence still remains through the popular x86
                    architecture. The 8086 was a fairly complex microprocessor
                    for its time, implementing instructions in microcode with
                    pipelining to improve performance. This blog post explains
                    the microcode operations for a particular instruction, "ADD
                    immediate". As the 8086 documentation will tell you, this
                    instruction takes four clock cycles to execute. But looking
                    internally shows seven clock cycles of activity. How does
                    the 8086 fit seven cycles of computation into four cycles?
                    As I will show, the trick is pipelining.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The alternative is microcode: instead of building the
                    control circuitry from complex logic gates, the control
                    logic is largely replaced with code. To execute a machine
                    instruction, the computer internally executes several
                    simpler micro-instructions, specified by the microcode. In
                    other words, microcode forms another layer between the
                    machine instructions and the hardware. The main advantage of
                    microcode is that it turns the processor's control logic
                    into a programming task instead of a difficult logic design
                    task.

                    "Hello, I just committed a crime and I want to confess," a
                    panicked sounding man said in a call to a police department
                    in February. "I've placed explosives inside a local school,'
                    the man continued.
                  </p>
                  <p>"You did what?!" the operator responded.</p>
                  <p>
                    "I've placed explosives inside a local school," the man said
                    again, before specifying Hempstead High School in Dubuque,
                    Iowa, and providing its address. In response to the threat,
                    the school went on lockdown, and police searched the school
                    but found nothing, according to a local media report.

                    The bombs weren't real. But, crucially, neither was the
                    man's voice. The panicked man's lines sound artificially
                    generated, according to recordings of the swatting calls
                    reviewed by Motherboard. It is unclear how exactly the
                    caller generated the voice, be that some form of artificial
                    intelligence tool or another speech synthesis program. The
                    result, though, is a voice that sounds very consistent
                    across multiple calls.

                    [...] Known as "Torswats" on the messaging app Telegram, the
                    swatter has been calling in bomb and mass shooting threats
                    against highschools and other locations across the country.
                    Torswat's connection to these wide ranging swatting
                    incidents has not been previously reported. The further
                    automation of swatting techniques threatens to make an
                    already dangerous harassment technique more prevalent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Torswats carries out these threatening calls as part
                    of a paid service they offer. For $75, Torswats says they
                    will close down a school. For $50, Torswats says customers
                    can buy "extreme swattings," in which authorities will
                    handcuff the victim and search the house. Torswats says they
                    offer discounts to returning customers, and can negotiate
                    prices for "famous people and targets such as Twitch
                    streamers." Torswats says on their Telegram channel that
                    they take payment in cryptocurrency.

                    PRIMO (principal-component interferometric modeling) was
                    used to study over 30,000 simulated images of black holes in
                    the process of accreting gas. It's the accretion of such
                    superheated material that gives imaged black holes their
                    eerie silhouettes. The patterns in the simulations were then
                    used to boost the resolution of the fuzzy image released in
                    2019.

                    True fans are not interested in the flood of AI-generated
                    material: they want authenticity from the writers they know
                    and whose works they love. True fans don't care if LLMs can
                    churn out pale imitations of their favourite creators for
                    almost zero cost. They are happy to support the future work
                    of traditional creators by paying a decent price for
                    material. They understand that LLMs may be able to produce
                    at an ever-cheaper cost, but that humans can't.

                    There's a place for publishers (and literary magazines) in
                    this world, helping writers connect with their readers, and
                    turning writing that fans support into publications offered
                    in a variety of formats, both digital and physical. But for
                    that to happen publishers must accept that they serve
                    creators. That's unlike today, where many writers are little
                    more than hired labourers churning out work for the larger
                    publishing houses to exploit.

                  <p>
                    In today's new world of slick, practically cost-free LLMs,
                    even the pittance of royalties will no longer be on offer to
                    most creators. It's time for the latter to move on to where
                    they are deeply appreciated, fairly paid, and really belong:
                    among their true fans.
