                The loss of dark skies is so painful,

              <p>
                Most of our light pollution comes from sources on the ground,
                but satellites don't just spoil deep-space astronomical
                observations when they cross a telescope's field of view; they
                also scatter and reflect sunlight from their solar arrays. The
                abundance of satellites is causing the overall brightness of the
                sky to increase all around the globe. Some researchers have
                estimated that, on average, our darkest night skies, located in
                the most remote regions of the world, are 10% brighter than they
                were a half century ago.
              </p>
              <p>
                Humans are ineffably impacted. How can someone who has never
                seen a clear night sky know what they are missing? It's like
                someone without gonads or genital nerves trying to understand
                orgasm.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many animal species are suffering as well. What good are
                night-adapted senses in nocturnal species if the night sky isn't
                much darker than the daytime sky? Researchers have identified
                several species whose circadian rhythms are getting thrown off,
                making them vulnerable to predation (or, the reverse: the
                inability to effectively locate prey).

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Amazon announced today that Prime Video users in the US,
                    Canada, Germany, and the UK will automatically start seeing
                    advertisements "in early 2024." Subscribers will receive a
                    notification email "several weeks" in advance, at which
                    point they can opt to pay $2.99 extra for ad-free Prime
                    Video, Amazon said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That takes the price of ad-free Prime Video from $8.99/month
                    alone to $11.98/month and from $14.99/month with Prime to
                    $17.98/month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Prime Video subscribers who don't pay the extra $2.99
                    (and don't just cancel their subscription altogether) are
                    promised "meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other
                    streaming TV providers."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] With current prices starting at $9.99 per month, Prime
                    Video was one of the cheapest ways to get streaming TV
                    without ads. While the changes put pricing for ad-free Prime
                    Video more on par with its competitors, it may still
                    disappoint budget-minded cord-cutters.

                      >Streaming services started off</a
                    >
                    as a cheaper, simpler alternative to cable TV. But as an
                    influx in services, changes in pricing, confusing bundles,
                    and scattered content have proven, we haven't gotten that
                    far from cable after all.

                    The dreaded rat lungworm—a parasite with a penchant for rats
                    and slugs that occasionally finds itself rambling and
                    writhing in human brains—has firmly established itself in
                    the Southeast US and will likely continue its rapid
                    invasion,
                    <a
                      href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/10/23-0706_article"

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study involved small-scale surveillance of dead rats in
                    the Atlanta zoo. Between 2019 and 2022, researchers
                    continually turned up evidence of the worm. In all, the
                    study identified seven out of 33 collected rats (21 percent)
                    with evidence of a rat lungworm infection. The infected
                    animals were spread throughout the study's time frame, all
                    in different months, with one in 2019, three in 2021, and
                    three in 2022, indicating sustained transmission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although small, the study "suggests that the zoonotic
                    parasite was introduced to and has become established in a
                    new area of the southeastern United States," the study's
                    authors, led by researchers at the University of Georgia
                    College of Veterinary Medicine, concluded. The study was
                    published Wednesday in the journal Emerging Infectious
                    Diseases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When a rat lungworm finds itself in a human, it does
                    what it usually does in rats—it heads to the central nervous
                    system and brain. Sometimes the migration of the worms to
                    the central nervous system is asymptomatic or only causes
                    mild transient symptoms. But, sometimes, they cause severe
                    neurological dysfunction. This can start with nonspecific
                    symptoms like headache, light sensitivity, and insomnia and
                    develop into neck stiffness and pain, tingling or burning of
                    the skin, double vision, bowel or bladder difficulties, and
                    seizures. In severe cases, it can cause nerve damage,
                    paralysis, coma, and even death.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's often thought that the worm can't complete its life
                    cycle in humans and that it ends up idly

                    However, there has been some evidence of adult worms
                    reaching the human lungs.

                  <p>
                    Regardless, there's no specific treatment for a rat lungworm
                    infection. No anti-parasitic drugs have proven effective,
                    and, in fact, there's some evidence they can make symptoms
                    worse by spurring more immune responses to dying worms. For
                    now, supportive treatment, pain medications, and steroids
                    are typically the only options.

                The BBC reports that Lego won't be making blocks from recycled
                drink bottles after all,

                It appears they did a full depth study over the last two years,
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Currently, many of Lego's bricks are made using
                    acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), a virgin plastic made
                    from crude oil.<br />...<br />In 2021, it said it has
                    developed prototype bricks made from polyethylene
                    terephthalate (PET) bottles, with some other chemicals
                    added.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The hope was that material could have offered an alternative
                    to oil-based bricks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Lego has now revealed that after more than two years of
                    testing, it had found that using recycled PET didn't reduce
                    carbon emissions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It said the reason for that was because extra steps were
                    required in the production process, which meant it needed to
                    use more energy.

                      * Good for Lego to come clean and not continue with
                "greenwashing".<br />
                      * What's wrong with wooden blocks anyway? I really enjoyed
                mine. They didn't lock me into a fixed attachment the way that
                Lego does. Don't be square (aka boring)!

                    [...] Under the newly announced plan, runtime fees will not

                    projects will now be able to stay on that free tier until
                    the developer behind them makes $200,000 in annual revenue,
                    an increase from the previous $100,000 revenue cap. And
                    Personal tier projects will no longer be required to put a
                    "Made with Unity" splash screen at the start of play.

                    In addition, Unity now says the new runtime fees will only
                    be incurred for projects that have reached $1 million in
                    revenue in the last 12 months and 1 million "initial

                    GWASs are a crucial tool in science, but they have their
                    limitations. Importantly, they can only find correlations
                    between a variant and a disease or trait. So more research
                    will be needed to confirm a causal relationship between this
                    newly discovered mutation and Parkinson’s and to learn how
                    it might be causing the disease. But GWASs are often
                    intended to provide scientists with new clues to track down.
                    And the authors say their research offers a clear example of
                    why it’s so important to include a wide array of people in
                    these studies.

                    “To effectively treat Parkinson’s and truly any disease, we
                    must study diverse populations to fully understand what the
                    drivers and risk factors are for these disorders,” said
                    study author Andrew B. Singleton, director of the NIH

                    disease can differ by ancestry, and understanding these
                    differences may provide new insights into the biology of

                    <i>Science of the Total Environment</i>, showcase an
                    international team of researchers led by the University of
                    Birmingham. They demonstrate the removal efficiency of four
                    carefully selected strains of water flea on diclofenac
                    (pharmaceutical), atrazine (pesticide), arsenic (heavy

                    Senior author Professor Luisa Orsini, from the University of
                    Birmingham, commented, "Our profound understanding of water
                    flea biology enabled us to pioneer a nature-inspired
                    tertiary wastewater treatment technology. This refines
                    municipal wastewater effluent and safeguards the ecological

                    "The water flea's remarkable ability to remain dormant for
                    centuries allows scientists to revive dormant populations
                    that endured varying historical pollution pressures.
                    Leveraging this trait, researchers sourced strains with
                    diverse tolerances to chemical pollutants, incorporating
                    them into the technology."

                    of wastewater effluent—meeting current and upcoming
                    regulatory requirements to produce reusable water suitable
                    for irrigation, industrial applications, and household use.
                    By preventing persistent chemicals from entering waterways,

                    Co-author Professor Karl Dearn, also from the School of

                    these remarkable water fleas into custom containment devices
                    to refine effluent before its final release. Once in place,
                    our technology largely maintains itself, attributed to the
                    water fleas' clonal reproduction capability."

                    technology provides a potentially revolutionary process for
                    sustainably removing persistent chemical pollutants from
                    wastewater. By preventing these chemicals from being
                    discharged, we can protect our environment and

                    Back in the late 1970s, the most popular memory chip was
                    Mostek's MK4116, holding a whopping (for the time) 16
                    kilobits. It provided storage for computers such as the
                    Apple II, TRS-80, ZX Spectrum, Commodore PET, IBM PC, and
                    Xerox Alto as well as video games such as Defender and
                    Missile Command. To see how the chip is implemented I opened
                    one up and reverse-engineered it. I expected the circuitry
                    to be similar to other chips of the era, using standard NMOS
                    gates, but it was much more complex than I expected, built
                    from low-power dynamic logic. The MK4116 also used advanced
                    manufacturing processes to fit 16,384 high-density memory
                    cells on the chip.

                    [...] In dynamic RAM, each bit is stored in a capacitor with
                    the bit's value, 0 or 1, represented by the voltage on the
                    capacitor.3 The advantage of dynamic RAM is that each memory
                    cell is very small, so a lot of data can be stored on one
                    chip.4 The downside of dynamic RAM is that the charge on a
                    capacitor leaks away after a few milliseconds. To avoid
                    losing data, dynamic RAM must be constantly refreshed: bits
                    are read from the capacitors, amplified, and then written
                    back to the capacitors. For the MK4116, all the data must be
                    refreshed every two milliseconds.

                    without any need for needles. A new one looks particularly
                    promising, as it produces oxygen to feed onboard islet
                    cells.

                    [...] One alternative to those injections involves
                    implanting islet cells that have either been harvested from
                    a cadaver or derived from stem cells. While doing so does
                    work in many cases, patients have to take immunosuppressive
                    drugs for the rest of their lives in order to keep those
                    cells from being rejected.

                  <p>
                    Scientists have tried encapsulating islet cells in tiny
                    flexible implants that shield the cells from the host's
                    immune system, yet still allow insulin produced by those
                    cells to diffuse into the bloodstream. These implants also
                    prevent life-sustaining oxygen from reaching the cells,
                    however, which means those cells won't last long.

                    Some implants have addressed that shortcoming by
                    incorporating either a preloaded oxygen chamber or chemical
                    reagents which produce oxygen. Both the oxygen and the
                    reagents run out over time, though, so the implants will
                    have to be replaced or refilled.

                    Seeking a longer-term alternative, a team from MIT and
                    Boston Children's Hospital recently developed the new
                    device.

                    It's packed with hundreds of thousands of islet cells, along
                    with a proton-exchange membrane that splits water vapor
                    (which occurs naturally in the body) into hydrogen and
                    oxygen. The hydrogen harmlessly diffuses, while the oxygen
                    goes into a storage chamber in the implant. A thin,
                    permeable membrane in that chamber then allows the oxygen to
                    flow through to the chamber containing the islet cells.

                    Oakland has undergone a similar process of asking residents

                    and how the government should reform its approach to crime.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We spoke to over 500 residents across parts of Oakland that
                    have been especially hard hit by crime and violence and who
                    live in areas that have historically been both overpoliced
                    and underserved with public resources.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We asked questions like, "What does safety or the lack of
                    safety look like here," and "What are some signs that the
                    community is doing well or not doing well?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These conversations covered a lot of ground—ground that was
                    similar to other conversations we've had about peace with
                    people who live in conflict zones or countries with long
                    histories of war.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some Oakland residents spoke about how kids are desensitized
                    to gunshots and violence or are arrested or kicked out of
                    their homes. We heard that these kids and teenagers
                    ultimately lose sight of how their lives—and the lives of
                    others—have value.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    High school students also reflected on the prevalence of
                    guns, shootings and gangs in their lives. As one told us, "I
                    want to go back" to a more innocent time, when "I didn't
                    know nothing about any of this."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But just as we know that violence and security are only two
                    aspects of people's understandings of peace, the same is
                    true of safety. The police—and even crime—are just two
                    aspects of how communities think about safety in their
                    everyday lives. They also think about economic
                    opportunities, public space and social connections.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We heard about how, when kids have basic life skills and job
                    skills training, or have mentors and role models, this can
                    give them choices that are alternatives to criminal activity
                    and help them invest back in their communities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We heard about block parties and
                    <a href="https://www.townnights.org/">town nights</a>, which
                    inspire people of different races and ethnicities to look
                    out for each other and build trust with their neighbors. "By
                    us, for us," as one resident put it.

                Neuralink are looking for a few test subjects that have either
                ALS or are quadriplegics to test their wireless brain human
                interface. A device that will control a computer keyboard with
                only the users mind. Also they want to test out how good their
                robot is at surgery but that is perhaps less appealing.

                    The PRIME Study (short for Precise Robotically Implanted
                    Brain-Computer Interface) – a groundbreaking investigational
                    medical device trial for our fully-implantable, wireless
                    brain-computer interface (BCI) – aims to evaluate the safety
                    of our implant (N1) and surgical robot (R1) and assess the
                    initial functionality of our BCI for enabling people with
                    paralysis to control external devices with their thoughts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During the study, the R1 Robot will be used to surgically
                    place the N1 Implant's ultra-fine and flexible threads in a
                    region of the brain that controls movement intention. Once
                    in place, the N1 Implant is cosmetically invisible and is
                    intended to record and transmit brain signals wirelessly to
                    an app that decodes movement intention. The initial goal of
                    our BCI is to grant people the ability to control a computer
                    cursor or keyboard using their thoughts alone.

                    a preliminary injunction stopping California Attorney
                    General Rob Bonta from enforcing the state's Age-Appropriate
                    Design Code Act (CAADCA), finding that the law likely
                    violates the First Amendment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The Court finds that although the stated purpose of the
                    Act—protecting children when they are online—clearly is
                    important," Freeman wrote, "the CAADCA likely violates the
                    First Amendment."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Specifically," Freeman said, "the age estimation and
                    privacy provisions thus appear likely to impede the
                    'availability and use' of information and accordingly to
                    regulate speech," and "the steps a business would need to
                    take to sufficiently estimate the age of child users would
                    likely prevent both children and adults from accessing
                    certain content."

                    [...] Regulators' attempts to age-gate the Internet have
                    drawn criticism, and courts have repeatedly found that these
                    laws likely run afoul of the First Amendment. But perhaps
                    more troubling, here, Freeman found that CAADCA not only
                    risked restricting speech, but also did not appear to
                    address or mitigate the harms to children identified by the
                    state. Even worse, after California argued that businesses
                    gathering information from children by requiring face scans
                    or other biometric data to estimate user ages was "minimally
                    invasive," Freeman concluded that enforcing the law could
                    cause more harm than good. "Such measures would appear to
                    counter the State's interest in increasing privacy
                    protections for children," Freeman wrote, explaining:

                        "CAADCA's age estimation provision appears not only
                        unlikely to materially alleviate the harm of
                        insufficient data and privacy protections for children,
                        but actually likely to exacerbate the problem by
                        inducing covered businesses to require consumers,

                    containing open-source code and AI models for image

                    were provided with a link from Azure, Microsoft's cloud

                    One problem: The link that was provided by Microsoft's AI
                    team gave visitors complete access to the entire Azure
                    storage account. And not only could visitors view everything

                [martyb ed. update: My first hard disk drive was a Seagare
                ST-231. It could store so much data that I had to partition it
                into two "devices" under Microsoft DOS 3.2: 32MB and 8MB. It was
                so large that I thought that nobody would be able to use all
                that disk space! Over time, newest drives has had: 80MB, 200MB,
                and 1TB. My current PC has a 2TB drive... and that is relatively
                "small" by today's standards. Microsoft lost <i>38TB</i>?!]

                Alex "Sandy" Pentland[1] is somewhere near the top of the AI
                pantheon these days, here's his most recent talk, "Engineering
                Ecosystems with AI", given online on Friday 15 Sept.,
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m8EsEmZPYQ"
                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m8EsEmZPYQ</a
                >
                at the MIT Mobility Forum. In the intro it is mentioned that
                this was a dry run for Pentland's upcoming keynote to the U. S.
                National Academy of Sciences. From the YT summary,
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    This talk covers how our society is having difficulties
                    engineering heterogeneous systems of people and
                    technologies; for instance, our systems for dealing with
                    pandemics, climate change, inequality, or financial stress
                    have been less than completely successful, in significant
                    part because of unanticipated human behaviors.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                He discusses recent work on models of panics, cascades and other
                highly nonlinear, long tailed phenomena--using aggregated census
                data--as an example of how AI and big data can be socially
                useful.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then he takes the data further, showing that when people move
                between communities (both locally and internationally with
                migration) is when progress really happens. AI may have a
                similar "melting pot" effect, helping mid-level workers/earners
                (which he defines) in closing some of the
                performance/creativity/earnings gap to high-level workers. In
                particular, AI developed on restricted and well defined training
                sets may not get the headlines of ChatGPT, but will be very
                useful in many fields.
              </p>
              <p>
                Near the end he quotes Xi Jinping of China to make it clear how
                big this social change is going to be (paraphrased):
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Xi is the largest representative, loudest voice for Marxism
                    and he recently said, 'data is a new primary means of
                    production along with capital and labor'. And if you think
                    about that, what he's saying is that classic Marxism is
                    done. It's now not a battle between capital and labor. It's
                    a battle between data, capital and labor and that sort of
                    gives you a sense of the magnitude of this problem.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you look at what society did with capital and labor, it
                    took a century or more, for instance, to form labor unions
                    to pressure companies, to establish principles to get laws
                    enacted. ... And it's not a fixed thing, it's not like you
                    can do it once and it's done. It evolves over time. So
                    currently we're in a new evolutionary phase of labor and a
                    new evolutionary phase of capital. The problem with data is
                    that we don't have *any* institutions, we don't have *any*
                    norms for it. It's new, so we're back in the robber baron
                    era of capital, we're back in the early industrial age where
                    kids were working 14 hour days. That's where we are with
                    data. Just face it! What we have to do is develop the right
                    institutions to be able to deal with this now-critical
                    element of society.

                I don't watch many videos, but this one was well worth the time.
                His actual talk is about 25 minutes, the rest of the hour is
                intro and many questions/discussions at the end.

                    packaging facility in the state, Katie Hobbs, governor of

                    TSMC has built Fab 21 in Arizona and is currently installing
                    production tools there. The company is also building up the
                    second phase of the fab and has approved plans to invest $40
                    billion in these two production facilities. But the company
                    apparently does not want to stop there and is discussing the
                    possibility of building an advanced packaging fab in the
                    state, too, as this will help it to assemble complex
                    system-in-packages for its clients from the U.S. on American
                    soil.

                    goes through a lot of the now-familiar arguments for why
                    Unity's decision to charge up to $0.20 per game install will
                    be bad for the industry. The federation of 23 national game
                    developer trade associations argues that the new fee
                    structure will make it "much harder for [small and midsize
                    developers] to build reliable business plans" by
                    "significantly increas[ing] the game development costs for
                    most game developers relying on [Unity's] services."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Beyond simply being bad for the industry, though, the
                    EGDF argues that "Unity's move might be anti-competitive" in
                    a way that demands government action. The group takes a
                    special exception to Unity's history of bundling its game
                    engine with services like analytics, in-game chat, ad
                    networks and mediation tools, user acquisition tools, and
                    more. That kind of bundling creates "a significant vendor
                    lock risk for game developers using Unity services," which
                    "also makes it difficult for many game middleware developers
                    to compete against Unity."

                  <p>
                    Some 500 years ago, construction workers in the midst of
                    building Ćmielów Castle in Poland carved a simple game board
                    into a slab of the sandstone floor as a diversion for their
                    leisure time. At least that's one possible scenario for the
                    existence of a game board recently discovered by
                    archaeologists in the castle ruins; it's also possible the
                    board could have been carved by children or by servants
                    after the castle was completed, or it may have been meant as
                    a symbolic message.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/archaeologists-discovered-a-4000-year-old-board-game-at-a-dig-in-oman/"
                      >previously reported</a
                    >, there is archaeological evidence for various kinds of
                    board games from all over the world dating back millennia:
                    Senet and Mehen in ancient Egypt, for example, or a strategy
                    game called ludus latrunculorum ("game of mercenaries")
                    favored by Roman legions. A 4,000-year-old board discovered
                    last year at an archaeological site in Oman's Qumayrah
                    Valley might be a precursor to an ancient Middle Eastern
                    game known as the Royal Game of Ur (or the Game of Twenty
                    Squares), a two-player game that may have been one of the
                    precursors to backgammon (or was simply replaced in
                    popularity by backgammon). Like backgammon, it's essentially
                    a race game in which players compete to see who can move all
                    their pieces along the board before their opponent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This latest discovery isn't quite as old as that in terms of
                    the actual carved board, but the game could be just as
                    ancient. According to archaeologist Tomasz Olszacki, it's a
                    two-person strategy board game called Mill, also known as
                    Nine Men's Morris, Merels, or "cowboy checkers" in North
                    America. The earliest-known Mill game board was found carved
                    into the roofing slabs of an Egyptian temple at Kurna, which
                    likely predates the Common Era. Historians believe it was
                    well-known to the Romans, who may have learned of the game
                    through trade routes.

                        One of the threats this emerging technology poses is to
                        weaken current encryption schemes, allowing protected
                        data to be decrypted quickly and gaining access to

                        Predictions on when powerful enough quantum computers
                        might emerge vary from 5 years to never. Nonetheless, we
                        already face the risk of "<a

                      <p>
                        For communication apps, like Signal, that use end-to-end
                        encryption to protect communication between two parties,
                        the concern is that encrypted communications can be
                        intercepted and deciphered to expose the contents of the
                        communication.

                    <b>Significance</b>:<br />
                    A consistent and comprehensive quantitative framework of the
                    cells in the human body could benefit many areas of biology.
                    We compile data to estimate cell mass, size range, and cell
                    count for some 1,200 cell groups, from the smallest red
                    blood cells to the largest muscle fibers, across 60 tissues
                    in a representative male, female, and 10-y-old child. We
                    find large-scale patterns revealing that both cellular
                    biomass in any given logarithmic cell-size class and the
                    coefficient of cell-size variation are both approximately
                    independent of cell size. These patterns are suggestive of a
                    whole-organism trade-off between cell size and count and
                    imply the existence of cell-size homeostasis across cell
                    types.

                    <b>Abstract</b>:<br />
                    Cell size and cell count are adaptively regulated and
                    intimately linked to growth and function. Yet, despite their
                    widespread relevance, the relation between cell size and
                    count has never been formally examined over the whole human
                    body. Here, we compile a comprehensive dataset of cell size
                    and count over all major cell types, with data drawn from
                    &gt;1,500 published sources. We consider the body of a
                    representative male (70 kg), which allows further estimates
                    of a female (60 kg) and 10-y-old child (32 kg). We build a
                    hierarchical interface for the cellular organization of the
                    body, giving easy access to data, methods, and sources (<a
                      href="https://humancelltreemap.mis.mpg.de/"
                      >https://humancelltreemap.mis.mpg.de/</a
                    >). In total, we estimate total body counts of ≈36 trillion
                    cells in the male, ≈28 trillion in the female, and ≈17
                    trillion in the child. These data reveal a surprising
                    inverse relation between cell size and count, implying a
                    trade-off between these variables, such that all cells
                    within a given logarithmic size class contribute an equal
                    fraction to the body's total cellular biomass. We also find
                    that the coefficient of variation is approximately
                    independent of mean cell size, implying the existence of
                    cell-size regulation across cell types. Our data serve to
                    establish a holistic quantitative framework for the cells of
                    the human body, and highlight large-scale patterns in cell
                    biology.

                    [...] [Nhat-Minh] Nguyen, U-M physics professor Dragan
                    Huterer and U-M graduate student Yuewei Wen examined the
                    temporal growth of large-scale structure throughout cosmic
                    time using several cosmological probes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, the team used what's called the cosmic microwave
                    background. The cosmic microwave background, or CMB, is
                    composed of photons emitted just after the Big Bang. These
                    photons provide a snapshot of the very early universe. As
                    the photons travel to our telescopes, their path can become
                    distorted, or gravitationally lensed, by large-scale
                    structure along the way. Examining them, the researchers can
                    infer how structure and matter between us and the cosmic
                    microwave background are distributed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nguyen and colleagues took advantage of a similar phenomenon
                    with weak gravitational lensing of galaxy shapes. Light from
                    background galaxies is distorted through gravitational
                    interactions with foreground matter and galaxies. The
                    cosmologists then decode these distortions to determine how
                    the intervening matter is distributed.<br />[...] The
                    findings potentially address the so-called S8 tension in
                    cosmology. S8 is a parameter that describes the growth of
                    structure. The tension arises when scientists use two
                    different methods to determine the value of S8, and they do
                    not agree. The first method, using photons from the cosmic
                    microwave background, indicates a higher S8 value than the
                    value inferred from galaxy weak gravitational lensing and
                    galaxy clustering measurements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Neither of these probes measures the growth of structure
                    today. Instead, they probe structure at earlier times, then
                    extrapolate those measurements to present time, assuming the
                    standard model. Cosmic microwave background probes structure
                    in the early universe, while galaxy weak gravitational
                    lensing and clustering probe structure in the late universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers' findings of a late-time suppression of
                    growth would bring the two S8 values into perfect agreement,
                    according to Nguyen.

                    Stressors like climate trauma, corporate deceit and
                    political incompetence signal the threat of societal
                    collapse, a new book asserts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This claim lays the foundation for exploring arguments of
                    "collapsology" in a new book by Robert R. Janes Ph.D.,

                    The book also contends with the unique role that can be
                    played by museums during a mounting climate crisis.

                    "Social ecology is an integral and moral dimension of the
                    collapse and the crisis we face—that social and
                    environmental issues are intertwined, and both must be
                    considered simultaneously," Dr. Janes, a Visiting Research
                    Fellow at the School of Museum Studies at the University of
                    Leicester, explains.

                    "Our collective failure to honor this relationship lies at
                    the core of our failure as species. It befits all museums,
                    irrespective of their disciplinary focus and loyalties, to
                    bridge the divide between nature and culture in all that

                    AMD has introduced its EPYC 8004-series processors codenamed
                    Siena. The new CPUs come in an all-new SP6 form-factor, pack
                    up to 64 Zen 4c cores, and feature a six-channel DDR5 memory
                    subsystem. AMD's EPYC 'Siena' processors are designed for
                    edge and communications servers that rely on one processor
                    and require advanced I/O and power efficiency more than raw
                    performance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The new EPYC 8004 Series processors extend AMD leadership
                    in single socket platforms by offering excellent CPU energy
                    efficiency in a package tuned to meet the needs of space and
                    power-constrained infrastructure," said Dan McNamara, senior
                    vice president and general manager, Server Business, AMD.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AMD's EPYC 8004-series 'Siena' processors for intelligent
                    edge applications use an all-new SP6 platform, but re-use
                    core components of Bergamo CPUs for high-density servers,
                    such four 16-core Zen 4c general-purpose chiplets as well as
                    I/O die used by the these CPUs. The processor feature from
                    eight to 64 cores clocked at 2.0 – 3.10 GHz and a TDP
                    ranging from 80W to 200W. Meanwhile, it is possible to
                    configure these processors for an up to 225W TDP or reduce
                    their power consumption to 70W.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While AMD's Zen 4c are smaller and less power hungry than
                    full-blown Zen 4 cores, they support the same feature set as
                    their larger counterparts and can therefore run applications
                    that rely on instructions like AVX-512. Although AMD's EPYC
                    9004-series processors deliver higher performance, AMD's
                    EPYC 8004-series CPUs promise a lower total cost of
                    ownership and higher power efficiency. AMD claims that Siena
                    offers an up to 2x better performance per watt compared to
                    competitors (Xeon Platinum 8490H, Xeon Platinum 8471N ) in
                    SPECpower_ssj 2008. Specifically, the EPYC 8324P showcases
                    up to 1.16x better performance per core in video encoding
                    tasks (than Intel's 32-core Xeon 6421N), according to
                    benchmark results conducted by AMD. In IoT Edge gateway
                    workloads, an eight-core EPYC 8024P offers nearly 1.8x the
                    total SPECrate 2017_int_base throughput performance per 8kW
                    rack against an eight-core competitor (Intel's Xeon Platinum
                    8471N).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new AMD EPYC 8004-series processors feature a
                    six-channel DDR5-4800 subsystem that supports up to 1.152 TB
                    of memory. Intelligent edge servers are a relatively new
                    type of application. Some of these machines can take
                    advantage of traditional CPUs, whereas the other pack
                    special-purpose accelerators. That said, modern I/O
                    capabilities is a must for such machines. Therefore, AMD's
                    Siena also support 96 PCIe 5.0 lanes with 48 of them
                    supporting the CXL 1.1+ protocol on top for advanced modern
                    accelerators (for AI inference or other applications) and/or
                    memory expanders.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AMD says that its EPYC 8004 'Siena' processors are now
                    available inside new edge servers from Dell (PowerEdge
                    C6615), Lenovo (ThinkEdge SE455 V3), and Supermicro (H13
                    generation of WIO Servers). The new CPUs are also endorsed
                    by Ericsson and Microsoft Azure.

                    Scientists have found a plant gene that drives the growth of
                    root hairs, the tiny structures that help plants find water
                    and nutrients in the soil.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Identified by a team led by Washington State University
                    researcher Karen Sanguinet, the gene, dubbed "BUZZ," causes
                    faster-growing, denser webs of roots and may also determine
                    how plants find and use nitrates, a prime source of nitrogen
                    essential to plant growth. Nitrates are also used in
                    fertilizers that can pollute the environment as runoff, and
                    this genetic discovery could ultimately help plant
                    scientists find ways to grow crops more sustainably.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Nitrate runoff and nitrogen use efficiency are some of the
                    preeminent issues facing agriculture," said Sanguinet,
                    associate professor in WSU's Department of Crop and Soil
                    Sciences. "If you can understand the genetic mechanisms that
                    control nitrate uptake and signaling, as well as how plants
                    can better use nitrate, it's advantageous for agriculture,
                    soil, water, fertilizer application and the entire nitrogen
                    cycle."
                  </p>

                    found that the BUZZ gene adjusts root growth—both the rate
                    and lateral root initiation—in response to the nitrate
                    concentration in nearby soil.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Expression of the BUZZ gene is turned up in response to
                    nitrate, urea, and ammonia presumably so that roots can find
                    nitrogen in the soil," Sanguinet said. "Loss of the gene
                    shows a foraging root phenotype even when the nitrate supply
                    is plentiful."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The gene is expressed at very low levels and had never been
                    described before, which made finding it more challenging.

                    Nerf has made plenty of fully-automatic blasters over the
                    years, but their toys typically lack punch, precision, and
                    fire rate. [3DprintedLife] set about building a blaster to
                    rectify that last shortcoming,
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESmGxkZOUbk"
                      >aiming for design that could fire 100 darts per
                      second.</a
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The design uses half length darts which tend to fly a little
                    nicer from high-powered blasters. It fires them using belts
                    driven by powerful motors, similar to wheel blasters. The
                    darts themselves are loaded into a drum magazine which has
                    sliders to push the darts into the wheels as the drum
                    rotates by.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It all sounds straightforward enough, but getting it all
                    working in harmony is a challenge—particularly at a fire
                    rate of 100 darts per second. The build video explains the
                    trials and tribulations involved in getting near that fire
                    rate, with darts getting shredded and magazines throwing out
                    parts along the way. A good helping of iterative design
                    helps get everything playing nice, with the darts neatly
                    leaving the magazine and flying downrange at great speed.
                    The slow-motion videos of darts flying out of the blaster in
                    rapid succession are a special treat.

                I found the embedded YouTube video to be amazing! Just the right

                debugging the gun!

                    are accusing of "extensive violations of federal copyright

                    Learning, McGraw Hill, and Pearson Education. They claim
                    that Library Genesis (aka Libgen) is operated by unknown
                    individuals based outside the United States, who know that
                    the shadow library is "one of the largest, most notorious,
                    and far-reaching infringement operations in the world" and
                    intentionally violate copyright laws with "absolutely no

                    Ars could not immediately reach publishers' lawyers or
                    Libgen for comment. [Update: Publishers' lawyer Matthew
                    Oppenheim told Ars that Libgen is a "thieves' den" of
                    illegal books, and "there is no question" that Libgen's
                    conduct is "massively illegal." Oppenheim said that "really,
                    the only question is why it's been allowed to exist this
                    long." He also said that it's possible that US companies may
                    not realize that they are aiding Libgen's infringement, but
                    publishers hope that when they "are confronted" with the
                    fact "that this library is massively illegal, that hopefully
                    they will voluntarily do the right thing" and cut off
                    Libgen.]

                    From Pitfall II to the Channel F to the NES cartridge port,
                    a spectre has lurked in the background of Nicole Express:
                    the spectre of the Atari 2600. The best-selling console of
                    the second generation, an icon, and yet to date, I have not
                    covered it, or even owned one. That all changes today, and
                    we'll find out what the deal is with this strange artifact
                    from the past. Plus, we'll get some S-Video.

                  <p>[...] Those three chips are right in the center:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The MOS Technology 6507 CPU. This is a 6502 die, with some
                      pins not hooked up. The implications of this are
                      important. The fact that this particular 6507 is made by
                      Taiwan-based UMC probably isn't.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The MOS Technology 6532 RIOT. This does exactly what the
                      name implies: it contains 128 bytes of RAM (twice the
                      Channel F!), provides two 8-bit I/O ports, and a

                    This new study was
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02565-4"

                    Thursday in the journal Nature Medicine. It involved over
                    100 people with moderate to severe PTSD who were randomized
                    into two groups: one group that received standard therapy
                    and the other that received therapy plus MDMA. Both groups
                    received three sessions each and were tracked for 18 weeks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By the end of the study period, the researchers found, those
                    on MDMA-assisted therapy were better off than the control
                    group on average. About 86% of the MDMA group achieved a
                    “clinically meaningful” improvement in their symptoms
                    compared to 69% of the control group, based on a standard
                    measuring scale of PTSD. And 71% of the former group
                    improved so much that they no longer met the criteria for
                    active PTSD, compared to 48% of the latter. No major safety
                    issues were identified among those taking MDMA, though some
                    common adverse effects included muscle tightness, nausea,
                    and sweating.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new results are in line with the findings from the first
                    Phase III trial funded by MAPS, also
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01336-3"

                    in Nature Medicine in 2021. But the new study, unlike the
                    first, was able to include a more diverse group of
                    participants this time around, an important consideration
                    for the approval of any new drug or therapy. Though not
                    everyone seems responsive to MDMA-assisted therapy, the
                    treatment could provide a valuable new option for people who
                    haven’t responded to existing medications or therapy.

                Sometime back I posted about Motor Trend (and prior hot rod
                magazines) converting their long time '57 Chevy project car to
                electric power. Now they have a followup article with lessons

                    mind if you entertain this questionable idea.

                It turned out there were a lot of details that they found out
                along the way and the result was a lot of work and not all that
                satisfying. Their summary is below, in case you want to read the
                story from the top.
              </p>
              So, was converting Project X worth it? Yeah, I would say it was,
              since we learned a ton about EV systems, swaps, and how it all
              works, or doesn't work, in our classic cars, trucks, and hot rods.
              Now, it was a fun exercise with someone else's wallet, but the new
              Chevrolet Performance ZZ632 big-block we installed is more fun,
              sounds great, and will allow us to roll on next year's HOT ROD
              Power Tour without towing a diesel generator behind us. Most of
              all, Project X sounds loud and mean like a hot rod should sound.
              <p>
                And, with the EV box checked, they've already moved on to the
                next power train for Project X --

                    "After the pandemic, we have started our Run 3 operations,
                    which creates higher luminosity, which generates much more
                    data. But in addition to that, the four experiments have had
                    a major upgrade to their detectors."

                    The back-end system monitoring the infrastructure that
                    supports the physics data had been based on the time series
                    database InfluxDB and the monitoring database Prometheus.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cornell University's Valentin Kuznetsov, a member of the CMS
                    team, said in a statement: "We were searching for
                    alternative solutions following performance issues with
                    Prometheus and InfluxDB."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In search for an alternative, the CMS monitoring team
                    came across VictoriaMetrics, a San Francisco startup built
                    around an open source wide column time series database, via
                    a Medium post by CTO and co-founder Aliaksandr Valialkin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Speaking to <em>The Register</em>, Roman Khavronenko,
                    co-founder of VictoriaMetrics, said the previous system had
                    experienced problems with high cardinality, which refers to
                    the level of repeated values – and high churn data – where
                    applications can be redeployed multiple times over new
                    instances.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Implementing VictoriaMetrics as backend storage for
                    Prometheus, the CMS monitoring team progressed to using the
                    solution as front-end storage to replace InfluxDB and
                    Prometheus, helping remove cardinality issues, the company
                    said in a statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The system runs in CERN's own datacenter, an OpenStack
                    service run on clusters of x86 machines.

                    The team tested this optimal ES hypothesis on aged mice,
                    treating them with bioelectric therapy for six weeks. At the
                    end of the trial, the animals had improved muscle mass and
                    muscle quality, compared to a control group. The muscles
                    also showed an uptick in contractile force and tissue
                    formation, suggesting the treatment didn't just rebuild mass
                    but improved function.

                    been used in hospitals and homes without considering the
                    optimal ES conditions," the team noted in the study.
                    "Through this research, we suggest that a specific ES for
                    sarcopenia needs to be applied to maximize the effect with

                    Ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus worked to accurately
                    catalog and record the coordinates of celestial objects. But
                    while Hipparchus' Star Catalogue is known to have existed,
                    the document itself is lost to history. Even so,

                    Hipparchus' Star Catalogue is the earliest known attempt to
                    record the positions of celestial bodies (predating

                    in the second century, which scholars believe was probably
                    substantially based on Hipparchus) but direct evidence of
                    the document is slim.<span></span>

                    That is somewhat less true after it was discovered that the

                    (the Northern Crown) appeared to be hidden within some
                    ancient documents. This led to further investigations, which
                    yielded a translated passage, some of the strongest evidence
                    yet of Hipparchus' lost work. It describes the Corona
                    Borealis and gives coordinates accurate within one degree;
                    considerably more precise than Ptolemy's calculations. A
                    remarkable achievement for a second-century scholar,
                    considering that the telescope would not be invented for
                    another 1500 years or so.

                    How was this information uncovered? Multispectral imaging of
                    a palimpsest manuscript (a parchment erased of writing, then
                    re-used) revealed the earlier markings, followed by
                    reconstruction and translation. In 2012 an undergraduate
                    student named Jamie Klair first noticed the astronomical
                    nature of of the undertext present in some pages of the
                    ancient Greek palimpsest known as the
                    <i>Codex Climaci Rescriptus</i>. Peter Williams, a biblical
                    scholar at Cambridge University, later noticed it contained
                    the astronomical measurements of the Corona Borealis in
                    2021, which led to the discoveries.

                    Despite the success of the two tests, there is concern that
                    Starship could end up delaying NASA’s Artemis missions.

              <p>
                I *just* realized that an editor on SoylentNews, janrinok (AKA
                JR), has very recently attained a huge milestone on our site:
              </p>
              <h1><b>8,000 stories!</b></h1>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                I can speak from personal experience that this represents a HUGE
                sacrifice of time and energy. He showed me the ropes in how to
                post a story. (There is FAR MORE than meets the eye to be an
                editor!) There was also the fact that in the early years of
                SoylentNews, he was simultaneously taking care of his severely
                ill wife. (She, sadly, passes away a few short years ago.) He
                endured some exceedingly heart-wrenching periods doing this. I
                have witnessed him posting stories even though he was beyond the
                point of exhaustion. So much so that his doctors *demanded* that
                he stop *everything* and take a break for many months.
              </p>
              <p>
                So it may not appear to be a huge milestone, please take my word
                for it. It is!

                    Containers, such as those used with Distrobox, enable users
                    to launch applications in a separate environment with full
                    write access. This approach is useful for applications that
                    must interact with the system at a deeper level.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Immutable distributions handle updates differently from
                    traditional ones. Updates are never applied in place;
                    instead, they create a new bootable system image. This
                    approach ensures that users always have access to the
                    previous version if issues arise after an update. While this
                    requires reboots, it enhances system stability and security.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Immutable distributions introduce complexity, especially for
                    users accustomed to traditional Linux distributions or other
                    operating systems like Windows or macOS. Basic tasks like
                    installing packages, updating, and manually editing config
                    files differ significantly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Immutable distributions require users to adapt to new ways
                    of performing familiar tasks. Installing packages, updating
                    the system, and even manually editing configuration files
                    may involve unfamiliar processes. This learning curve can be
                    steep for those new to this approach.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Immutable distributions may not suit users who value the
                    ability to access and modify any file at any time. The
                    restrictions imposed by these distributions can be seen as
                    limiting, especially when compared to traditional Linux
                    distributions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Immutable distributions offer unique benefits, making them a
                    valuable option, particularly for server environments and
                    specialized appliances. However, their limitations and
                    complexity may hinder their adoption among regular desktop
                    users. While they won't replace traditional Linux
                    distributions, they will likely coexist, catering to
                    different use cases and preferences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In conclusion, immutable distributions represent a promising
                    evolution of Linux operating systems, emphasizing security,
                    reliability, and ease of maintenance. Whether they become
                    the standard or remain a niche choice depends on individual
                    needs and priorities. Immutable distributions offer an
                    alternative approach to Linux, one that can be better suited
                    to specific scenarios but may not be the right fit for
                    everyone.

                    project that makes $200,000 in a 12-month period or has
                    200,000-lifetime game installs for those who subscribe to
                    the cheaper engine subscription plans. Those companies
                    paying for the higher-end Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise
                    plans had to reach either $1 million in revenue or 1 million
                    lifetime installs before they paid a fee.

                  <p>
                    On Sunday, Unity posted a

                    saying “We apologize for the confusion and angst,” regarding
                    its big plan to force devs to pay more when they succeed.
                    Unity said it was “listening” to the critique, adding it
                    would share an update in a few days describing its new

                    Unity’s plans to skim additional money off the top from
                    Unity developers did not exactly engender goodwill with the
                    people who put the software to use. Those subscribing to the
                    cheaper Unity Personal or Unity Plus plans would have been
                    forced to pay $.20 for every game installed past the
                    threshold. Those larger companies paying more would have to
                    fork over between $.02 and $.125 for every install.

                    showed that Unity would charge per install, even if it was

                    on a separate device.

                    [...] There’s no word on what changes Unity plans to make to
                    its fee structure, but for many devs, the damage is already
                    done. Newman wrote on his company’s

                    “We used the engine because you pay [upfront] and then ship
                    your product,” Newman wrote. “We weren’t told this was going
                    to happen. We weren’t warned. We weren’t consulted… We can
                    see what they can and are willing to do. You can’t un-ring

                    A gorgeous new image from the James Webb Space Telescope

                    coming from a very young star. Called a

                    effects of huge jets of gas that are thrown out by the star
                    and which collide with clouds of dust and gas to create

                    The image was taken in the infrared wavelength in which Webb
                    operates, which is ideal for observing hot objects like new
                    stars without the view being blocked by dust, which is
                    opaque in the visible light wavelength. The observations

                    A cyber criminal gang proficient in impersonation and
                    malware has been identified as the likely culprit for an
                    attack that paralized networks at US casino operator MGM
                    Resorts International.

                    The group, which security researchers call "Scattered
                    Spider," uses fraudulent phone calls to employees and help
                    desks to "phish" for login credentials. It has targeted MGM
                    and dozens of other Western companies with the aim of
                    extracting ransom payments, according to two people familiar
                    with the situation.

                    The operator of hotel casinos on the Las Vegas Strip,
                    including the Bellagio, Aria, Cosmopolitan, and Excalibur,
                    preemptively shut down large parts of its internal networks
                    after discovering the breach on Sunday, one of the people
                    said.

                    The effort to contain the hackers caused chaos. Slot
                    machines stopped working, electronic transfers of winnings
                    slowed down, and key cards for thousands of hotel rooms no
                    longer functioned. MGM did not respond to a request for

                    Chandrayaan means "moon vehicle" in Hindi and Sanskrit. The
                    vehicle took off from a launch pad in southern India on July
                    14 and completed a 'soft landing' on the moon nine days
                    later. A soft landing is when the space shuttle is kept
                    intact.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Attempts by various space agencies have been made to land on
                    the south pole of the moon, but it's notoriously difficult
                    to do, thanks to rugged terrain, extreme temperatures, lack
                    of light and communication difficulties.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Humans have been landing on the equator of the moon for
                    more than half a century," says Dr. McKemmish. "And while a
                    soft landing is always more technical, when the landscape is
                    more cratered, such as it is at the south pole, that landing
                    becomes even harder. There's also increased complexities
                    with communication at the poles, compared to the equator."

                  <p>
                    Chandrayaan–3 will be running a series of experiments
                    including a spectrometer analysis of the mineral composition
                    of the lunar surface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Generally a moon rover will be digging up samples, taking
                    lots of photos, and taking various spectral readings
                    investigating how the material interacts with light," says
                    Dr. McKemmish.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "For this mission, the spectroscopic technique used is
                    basically focusing a laser on the surface, causing the moon
                    rocks to become a plasma. This plasma emits colors of light
                    depending on its composition and thus this measurement tells
                    us a lot about the geology and history of the rock."

                    In a controversial bid to expose supposed bias in a top
                    journal, a US climate expert shocked fellow scientists by
                    revealing he tailored a wildfire study to emphasize global
                    warming.
                  </p>

                    While supporters applauded Patrick T. Brown for flagging
                    what he called a one-sided climate "narrative" in academic
                    publishing, his move surprised at least one of his
                    co-authors—and angered the editors of leading journal
                    <i>Nature</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I left out the full truth to get my climate change paper
                    published," read the headline to an article signed by Brown
                    in the news site The Free Press on September 5.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He said he deliberately focused on the impact from higher
                    temperatures on wildfire risk in a study in the journal,
                    excluding other factors such as land management.

                    in <i>Nature</i> because I stuck to a narrative I knew the
                    editors would like," the article read. "That's not the way
                    science should work."

                  <p>
                    One of the named co-authors of the study, Steven J. Davis, a
                    professor in the earth system science department at the
                    University of California, Irvine, told AFP Brown's comments
                    took him "by surprise".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Patrick may have made decisions that he thought would help
                    the paper be published, but we don't know whether a
                    different paper would have been rejected," he said in an
                    email.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    claims that editors and reviewers are biased."

                  <p>
                    [...] "It is unfortunate, but not surprising, that Patrick
                    felt like he had to be a willing participant in
                    oversimplifying his work to have a career in science. In
                    that long run, that is not a service to him, the field, or

                    Browsing the Asian marketplaces online is always an
                    experience. Sometimes, you see things at ridiculously low
                    prices. Other times, you see things and wonder who is buying
                    them and why — a shrimp pillow? But sometimes, you see
                    something that probably could have a more useful purpose
                    than the proposed use case.

                    listings. As you might expect, though, someone has

                    available data that's very difficult to erase from the
                    internet," Kelley told <em>The Register</em>. "Most people

                    and $100, manufacturers must provide consumers and
                    independent repair shops with replacement parts and repair
                    manuals for three years after the initial manufacture date.
                    That timespan extends to seven years for devices costing
                    over $100. Although the law goes into effect on July 1,
                    2024, it applies retroactively to products manufactured
                    after July 1, 2021.

                  <p>
                    The law mainly applies to devices like phones, tablets,
                    laptops, and other general-purpose appliances, but not alarm
                    systems or video game consoles. Although manufacturers
                    extracted fewer concessions in California than Minnesota or
                    New York, a few significant ones remain.

                    First, the bill doesn't require companies to provide
                    instructions for bypassing security measures, which can
                    often prove a significant obstacle to independent repairs.

                    is notorious for using software locks to force users to
                    spend extra money on first-party maintenance and
                    replacements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another caveat to the California bill is that independent
                    repair vendors must disclose when they use refurbished
                    replacement parts or originate components from third-party
                    makers. This condition could affect how companies handle
                    issues such as official repairs or warranties.
