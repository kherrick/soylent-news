              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Some 500 years ago, construction workers in the midst of
                    building Ćmielów Castle in Poland carved a simple game board
                    into a slab of the sandstone floor as a diversion for their
                    leisure time. At least that's one possible scenario for the
                    existence of a game board recently discovered by
                    archaeologists in the castle ruins; it's also possible the
                    board could have been carved by children or by servants
                    after the castle was completed, or it may have been meant as
                    a symbolic message.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/archaeologists-discovered-a-4000-year-old-board-game-at-a-dig-in-oman/"
                      >previously reported</a
                    >, there is archaeological evidence for various kinds of
                    board games from all over the world dating back millennia:
                    Senet and Mehen in ancient Egypt, for example, or a strategy
                    game called ludus latrunculorum ("game of mercenaries")
                    favored by Roman legions. A 4,000-year-old board discovered
                    last year at an archaeological site in Oman's Qumayrah
                    Valley might be a precursor to an ancient Middle Eastern
                    game known as the Royal Game of Ur (or the Game of Twenty
                    Squares), a two-player game that may have been one of the
                    precursors to backgammon (or was simply replaced in
                    popularity by backgammon). Like backgammon, it's essentially
                    a race game in which players compete to see who can move all
                    their pieces along the board before their opponent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This latest discovery isn't quite as old as that in terms of
                    the actual carved board, but the game could be just as
                    ancient. According to archaeologist Tomasz Olszacki, it's a
                    two-person strategy board game called Mill, also known as
                    Nine Men's Morris, Merels, or "cowboy checkers" in North
                    America. The earliest-known Mill game board was found carved
                    into the roofing slabs of an Egyptian temple at Kurna, which
                    likely predates the Common Era. Historians believe it was
                    well-known to the Romans, who may have learned of the game
                    through trade routes.

                        One of the threats this emerging technology poses is to
                        weaken current encryption schemes, allowing protected
                        data to be decrypted quickly and gaining access to
                        encrypted secrets.

                        Predictions on when powerful enough quantum computers
                        might emerge vary from 5 years to never. Nonetheless, we
                        already face the risk of "<a

                        important.

                      <p>
                        For communication apps, like Signal, that use end-to-end
                        encryption to protect communication between two parties,
                        the concern is that encrypted communications can be
                        intercepted and deciphered to expose the contents of the
                        communication.

                Several cool talks focused on immutable distributions: their
                usages and virtues, particularly
                <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS.</a> NixOS is the foremost
                immutable, reproducable, and atomically upgradable Linux
                distribution, and a powerful building block for building easily
                deployable services.

                    A consistent and comprehensive quantitative framework of the
                    cells in the human body could benefit many areas of biology.
                    We compile data to estimate cell mass, size range, and cell
                    count for some 1,200 cell groups, from the smallest red
                    blood cells to the largest muscle fibers, across 60 tissues
                    in a representative male, female, and 10-y-old child. We
                    find large-scale patterns revealing that both cellular
                    biomass in any given logarithmic cell-size class and the
                    coefficient of cell-size variation are both approximately
                    independent of cell size. These patterns are suggestive of a
                    whole-organism trade-off between cell size and count and
                    imply the existence of cell-size homeostasis across cell
                    types.

                    <b>Abstract</b>:<br />
                    Cell size and cell count are adaptively regulated and
                    intimately linked to growth and function. Yet, despite their
                    widespread relevance, the relation between cell size and
                    count has never been formally examined over the whole human
                    body. Here, we compile a comprehensive dataset of cell size
                    and count over all major cell types, with data drawn from
                    &gt;1,500 published sources. We consider the body of a
                    representative male (70 kg), which allows further estimates
                    of a female (60 kg) and 10-y-old child (32 kg). We build a
                    hierarchical interface for the cellular organization of the
                    body, giving easy access to data, methods, and sources (<a
                      href="https://humancelltreemap.mis.mpg.de/"
                      >https://humancelltreemap.mis.mpg.de/</a
                    >). In total, we estimate total body counts of ≈36 trillion
                    cells in the male, ≈28 trillion in the female, and ≈17
                    trillion in the child. These data reveal a surprising
                    inverse relation between cell size and count, implying a
                    trade-off between these variables, such that all cells
                    within a given logarithmic size class contribute an equal
                    fraction to the body's total cellular biomass. We also find
                    that the coefficient of variation is approximately
                    independent of mean cell size, implying the existence of
                    cell-size regulation across cell types. Our data serve to
                    establish a holistic quantitative framework for the cells of
                    the human body, and highlight large-scale patterns in cell
                    biology.

                  <p>
                    First, the team used what's called the cosmic microwave
                    background. The cosmic microwave background, or CMB, is
                    composed of photons emitted just after the Big Bang. These
                    photons provide a snapshot of the very early universe. As
                    the photons travel to our telescopes, their path can become
                    distorted, or gravitationally lensed, by large-scale
                    structure along the way. Examining them, the researchers can
                    infer how structure and matter between us and the cosmic
                    microwave background are distributed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nguyen and colleagues took advantage of a similar phenomenon
                    with weak gravitational lensing of galaxy shapes. Light from
                    background galaxies is distorted through gravitational
                    interactions with foreground matter and galaxies. The
                    cosmologists then decode these distortions to determine how
                    the intervening matter is distributed.<br />[...] The
                    findings potentially address the so-called S8 tension in
                    cosmology. S8 is a parameter that describes the growth of
                    structure. The tension arises when scientists use two
                    different methods to determine the value of S8, and they do
                    not agree. The first method, using photons from the cosmic
                    microwave background, indicates a higher S8 value than the
                    value inferred from galaxy weak gravitational lensing and
                    galaxy clustering measurements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Neither of these probes measures the growth of structure
                    today. Instead, they probe structure at earlier times, then
                    extrapolate those measurements to present time, assuming the
                    standard model. Cosmic microwave background probes structure
                    in the early universe, while galaxy weak gravitational
                    lensing and clustering probe structure in the late universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers' findings of a late-time suppression of
                    growth would bring the two S8 values into perfect agreement,
                    according to Nguyen.

                    Stressors like climate trauma, corporate deceit and
                    political incompetence signal the threat of societal
                    collapse, a new book asserts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This claim lays the foundation for exploring arguments of
                    "collapsology" in a new book by Robert R. Janes Ph.D.,

                    The book also contends with the unique role that can be
                    played by museums during a mounting climate crisis.

                    "Social ecology is an integral and moral dimension of the
                    collapse and the crisis we face—that social and
                    environmental issues are intertwined, and both must be
                    considered simultaneously," Dr. Janes, a Visiting Research
                    Fellow at the School of Museum Studies at the University of
                    Leicester, explains.

                    "Our collective failure to honor this relationship lies at
                    the core of our failure as species. It befits all museums,
                    irrespective of their disciplinary focus and loyalties, to
                    bridge the divide between nature and culture in all that

                    AMD has introduced its EPYC 8004-series processors codenamed
                    Siena. The new CPUs come in an all-new SP6 form-factor, pack
                    up to 64 Zen 4c cores, and feature a six-channel DDR5 memory
                    subsystem. AMD's EPYC 'Siena' processors are designed for
                    edge and communications servers that rely on one processor
                    and require advanced I/O and power efficiency more than raw
                    performance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The new EPYC 8004 Series processors extend AMD leadership
                    in single socket platforms by offering excellent CPU energy
                    efficiency in a package tuned to meet the needs of space and
                    power-constrained infrastructure," said Dan McNamara, senior
                    vice president and general manager, Server Business, AMD.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AMD's EPYC 8004-series 'Siena' processors for intelligent
                    edge applications use an all-new SP6 platform, but re-use
                    core components of Bergamo CPUs for high-density servers,
                    such four 16-core Zen 4c general-purpose chiplets as well as
                    I/O die used by the these CPUs. The processor feature from
                    eight to 64 cores clocked at 2.0 – 3.10 GHz and a TDP
                    ranging from 80W to 200W. Meanwhile, it is possible to
                    configure these processors for an up to 225W TDP or reduce
                    their power consumption to 70W.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While AMD's Zen 4c are smaller and less power hungry than
                    full-blown Zen 4 cores, they support the same feature set as
                    their larger counterparts and can therefore run applications
                    that rely on instructions like AVX-512. Although AMD's EPYC
                    9004-series processors deliver higher performance, AMD's
                    EPYC 8004-series CPUs promise a lower total cost of
                    ownership and higher power efficiency. AMD claims that Siena
                    offers an up to 2x better performance per watt compared to
                    competitors (Xeon Platinum 8490H, Xeon Platinum 8471N ) in
                    SPECpower_ssj 2008. Specifically, the EPYC 8324P showcases
                    up to 1.16x better performance per core in video encoding
                    tasks (than Intel's 32-core Xeon 6421N), according to
                    benchmark results conducted by AMD. In IoT Edge gateway
                    workloads, an eight-core EPYC 8024P offers nearly 1.8x the
                    total SPECrate 2017_int_base throughput performance per 8kW
                    rack against an eight-core competitor (Intel's Xeon Platinum
                    8471N).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new AMD EPYC 8004-series processors feature a
                    six-channel DDR5-4800 subsystem that supports up to 1.152 TB
                    of memory. Intelligent edge servers are a relatively new
                    type of application. Some of these machines can take
                    advantage of traditional CPUs, whereas the other pack
                    special-purpose accelerators. That said, modern I/O
                    capabilities is a must for such machines. Therefore, AMD's
                    Siena also support 96 PCIe 5.0 lanes with 48 of them
                    supporting the CXL 1.1+ protocol on top for advanced modern
                    accelerators (for AI inference or other applications) and/or
                    memory expanders.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AMD says that its EPYC 8004 'Siena' processors are now
                    available inside new edge servers from Dell (PowerEdge
                    C6615), Lenovo (ThinkEdge SE455 V3), and Supermicro (H13
                    generation of WIO Servers). The new CPUs are also endorsed
                    by Ericsson and Microsoft Azure.

                    Gene required for root hair growth, nitrate foraging found
                    in grasses
                  </p>

                    Scientists have found a plant gene that drives the growth of
                    root hairs, the tiny structures that help plants find water
                    and nutrients in the soil.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Identified by a team led by Washington State University
                    researcher Karen Sanguinet, the gene, dubbed "BUZZ," causes
                    faster-growing, denser webs of roots and may also determine
                    how plants find and use nitrates, a prime source of nitrogen
                    essential to plant growth. Nitrates are also used in
                    fertilizers that can pollute the environment as runoff, and
                    this genetic discovery could ultimately help plant
                    scientists find ways to grow crops more sustainably.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Nitrate runoff and nitrogen use efficiency are some of the
                    preeminent issues facing agriculture," said Sanguinet,
                    associate professor in WSU's Department of Crop and Soil
                    Sciences. "If you can understand the genetic mechanisms that
                    control nitrate uptake and signaling, as well as how plants
                    can better use nitrate, it's advantageous for agriculture,
                    soil, water, fertilizer application and the entire nitrogen
                    cycle."

                    The study, published in the journal

                    found that the BUZZ gene adjusts root growth—both the rate
                    and lateral root initiation—in response to the nitrate
                    concentration in nearby soil.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Expression of the BUZZ gene is turned up in response to
                    nitrate, urea, and ammonia presumably so that roots can find
                    nitrogen in the soil," Sanguinet said. "Loss of the gene
                    shows a foraging root phenotype even when the nitrate supply
                    is plentiful."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The gene is expressed at very low levels and had never been
                    described before, which made finding it more challenging.

                    Nerf has made plenty of fully-automatic blasters over the
                    years, but their toys typically lack punch, precision, and
                    fire rate. [3DprintedLife] set about building a blaster to
                    rectify that last shortcoming,
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESmGxkZOUbk"
                      >aiming for design that could fire 100 darts per
                      second.</a
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The design uses half length darts which tend to fly a little
                    nicer from high-powered blasters. It fires them using belts
                    driven by powerful motors, similar to wheel blasters. The
                    darts themselves are loaded into a drum magazine which has
                    sliders to push the darts into the wheels as the drum
                    rotates by.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It all sounds straightforward enough, but getting it all
                    working in harmony is a challenge—particularly at a fire
                    rate of 100 darts per second. The build video explains the
                    trials and tribulations involved in getting near that fire
                    rate, with darts getting shredded and magazines throwing out
                    parts along the way. A good helping of iterative design
                    helps get everything playing nice, with the darts neatly
                    leaving the magazine and flying downrange at great speed.
                    The slow-motion videos of darts flying out of the blaster in
                    rapid succession are a special treat.

                    are accusing of "extensive violations of federal copyright

                    that Library Genesis (aka Libgen) is operated by unknown
                    individuals based outside the United States, who know that
                    the shadow library is "one of the largest, most notorious,
                    and far-reaching infringement operations in the world" and
                    intentionally violate copyright laws with "absolutely no

                    Ars could not immediately reach publishers' lawyers or
                    Libgen for comment. [Update: Publishers' lawyer Matthew
                    Oppenheim told Ars that Libgen is a "thieves' den" of
                    illegal books, and "there is no question" that Libgen's
                    conduct is "massively illegal." Oppenheim said that "really,
                    the only question is why it's been allowed to exist this
                    long." He also said that it's possible that US companies may
                    not realize that they are aiding Libgen's infringement, but
                    publishers hope that when they "are confronted" with the

                    From Pitfall II to the Channel F to the NES cartridge port,
                    a spectre has lurked in the background of Nicole Express:
                    the spectre of the Atari 2600. The best-selling console of
                    the second generation, an icon, and yet to date, I have not
                    covered it, or even owned one. That all changes today, and
                    we'll find out what the deal is with this strange artifact
                    from the past. Plus, we'll get some S-Video.
                  </p>
                  <p>[...] Those three chips are right in the center:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The MOS Technology 6507 CPU. This is a 6502 die, with some
                      pins not hooked up. The implications of this are
                      important. The fact that this particular 6507 is made by
                      Taiwan-based UMC probably isn't.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The MOS Technology 6532 RIOT. This does exactly what the
                      name implies: it contains 128 bytes of RAM (twice the
                      Channel F!), provides two 8-bit I/O ports, and a
                      programmable Timer. It's also made by UMC.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The Atari Television Interface Adapter (TIA). The only
                      real custom chip onboard, the TIA is what made the 2600
                      the 2600. It generates a video signal using various
                      internal registers, as well as handling paddles, sound,
                      and some other functions. Someone wrote on this one.

                    This new study was
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02565-4"
                      >published</a

                    Thursday in the journal Nature Medicine. It involved over
                    100 people with moderate to severe PTSD who were randomized
                    into two groups: one group that received standard therapy
                    and the other that received therapy plus MDMA. Both groups
                    received three sessions each and were tracked for 18 weeks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By the end of the study period, the researchers found, those
                    on MDMA-assisted therapy were better off than the control
                    group on average. About 86% of the MDMA group achieved a
                    “clinically meaningful” improvement in their symptoms
                    compared to 69% of the control group, based on a standard
                    measuring scale of PTSD. And 71% of the former group
                    improved so much that they no longer met the criteria for
                    active PTSD, compared to 48% of the latter. No major safety
                    issues were identified among those taking MDMA, though some
                    common adverse effects included muscle tightness, nausea,
                    and sweating.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new results are in line with the findings from the first
                    Phase III trial funded by MAPS, also
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01336-3"
                      >published</a
                    >
                    in Nature Medicine in 2021. But the new study, unlike the
                    first, was able to include a more diverse group of
                    participants this time around, an important consideration
                    for the approval of any new drug or therapy. Though not
                    everyone seems responsive to MDMA-assisted therapy, the
                    treatment could provide a valuable new option for people who
                    haven’t responded to existing medications or therapy.

                Sometime back I posted about Motor Trend (and prior hot rod
                magazines) converting their long time '57 Chevy project car to
                electric power. Now they have a followup article with lessons

                    The Case for Not EV-Converting Your Classic Car - What we
                    learned from EV-swapping Project X, and things to keep in
                    mind if you entertain this questionable idea.

                It turned out there were a lot of details that they found out
                along the way and the result was a lot of work and not all that
                satisfying. Their summary is below, in case you want to read the
                story from the top.
              </p>
              So, was converting Project X worth it? Yeah, I would say it was,
              since we learned a ton about EV systems, swaps, and how it all
              works, or doesn't work, in our classic cars, trucks, and hot rods.
              Now, it was a fun exercise with someone else's wallet, but the new
              Chevrolet Performance ZZ632 big-block we installed is more fun,
              sounds great, and will allow us to roll on next year's HOT ROD
              Power Tour without towing a diesel generator behind us. Most of
              all, Project X sounds loud and mean like a hot rod should sound.
              <p>
                And, with the EV box checked, they've already moved on to the
                next power train for Project X --

                    The back-end system monitoring the infrastructure that

                    Cornell University's Valentin Kuznetsov, a member of the CMS
                    team, said in a statement: "We were searching for
                    alternative solutions following performance issues with

                    [...] In search for an alternative, the CMS monitoring team
                    came across VictoriaMetrics, a San Francisco startup built
                    around an open source wide column time series database, via
                    a Medium post by CTO and co-founder Aliaksandr Valialkin.

                    Speaking to <em>The Register</em>, Roman Khavronenko,
                    co-founder of VictoriaMetrics, said the previous system had
                    experienced problems with high cardinality, which refers to
                    the level of repeated values – and high churn data – where
                    applications can be redeployed multiple times over new

                    Implementing VictoriaMetrics as backend storage for
                    Prometheus, the CMS monitoring team progressed to using the
                    solution as front-end storage to replace InfluxDB and
                    Prometheus, helping remove cardinality issues, the company

                    The team tested this optimal ES hypothesis on aged mice,
                    treating them with bioelectric therapy for six weeks. At the

                    muscle quality, compared to a control group. The muscles
                    also showed an uptick in contractile force and tissue

                    while Hipparchus' Star Catalogue is known to have existed,

                    (the Northern Crown) appeared to be hidden within some
                    ancient documents. This led to further investigations, which
                    yielded a translated passage, some of the strongest evidence
                    yet of Hipparchus' lost work. It describes the Corona
                    Borealis and gives coordinates accurate within one degree;
                    considerably more precise than Ptolemy's calculations. A
                    remarkable achievement for a second-century scholar,
                    considering that the telescope would not be invented for

                    How was this information uncovered? Multispectral imaging of
                    a palimpsest manuscript (a parchment erased of writing, then
                    re-used) revealed the earlier markings, followed by
                    reconstruction and translation. In 2012 an undergraduate
                    student named Jamie Klair first noticed the astronomical
                    nature of of the undertext present in some pages of the
                    ancient Greek palimpsest known as the
                    <i>Codex Climaci Rescriptus</i>. Peter Williams, a biblical
                    scholar at Cambridge University, later noticed it contained
                    the astronomical measurements of the Corona Borealis in
                    2021, which led to the discoveries.

                    Despite the success of the two tests, there is concern that
                    Starship could end up delaying NASA’s Artemis missions.
                    Earlier in June, NASA’s Associate Administrator Jim Free
                    said that

                      delays</a
                    >. Free’s concern followed Starship’s first test flight in
                    April, which ended with the rocket exploding in the skies.

                    The space agency has a dozen RS-25 engines taken from

                    stage, four engines have already been used for the Artemis 1
                    mission in 2022. The four engines are located at the base of
                    the rocket’s core stage, and will fire non-stop for over
                    eight minutes during launch and flight.

              <p>
                I *just* realized that an editor on SoylentNews, janrinok (AKA
                JR), has very recently attained a huge milestone on our site:
              </p>
              <h1><b>8,000 stories!</b></h1>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                I can speak from personal experience that this represents a HUGE
                sacrifice of time and energy. He showed me the ropes in how to
                post a story. (There is FAR MORE than meets the eye to be an
                editor!) There was also the fact that in the early years of
                SoylentNews, he was simultaneously taking care of his severely
                ill wife. (She, sadly, passes away a few short years ago.) He
                endured some exceedingly heart-wrenching periods doing this. I
                have witnessed him posting stories even though he was beyond the
                point of exhaustion. So much so that his doctors *demanded* that
                he stop *everything* and take a break for many months.
              </p>
              <p>
                So it may not appear to be a huge milestone, please take my word
                for it. It is!

                    Containers, such as those used with Distrobox, enable users
                    to launch applications in a separate environment with full
                    write access. This approach is useful for applications that
                    must interact with the system at a deeper level.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Immutable distributions handle updates differently from
                    traditional ones. Updates are never applied in place;
                    instead, they create a new bootable system image. This
                    approach ensures that users always have access to the
                    previous version if issues arise after an update. While this
                    requires reboots, it enhances system stability and security.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Immutable distributions introduce complexity, especially for
                    users accustomed to traditional Linux distributions or other
                    operating systems like Windows or macOS. Basic tasks like
                    installing packages, updating, and manually editing config
                    files differ significantly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Immutable distributions require users to adapt to new ways
                    of performing familiar tasks. Installing packages, updating
                    the system, and even manually editing configuration files
                    may involve unfamiliar processes. This learning curve can be
                    steep for those new to this approach.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Immutable distributions may not suit users who value the
                    ability to access and modify any file at any time. The
                    restrictions imposed by these distributions can be seen as
                    limiting, especially when compared to traditional Linux
                    distributions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Immutable distributions offer unique benefits, making them a
                    valuable option, particularly for server environments and
                    specialized appliances. However, their limitations and
                    complexity may hinder their adoption among regular desktop
                    users. While they won't replace traditional Linux
                    distributions, they will likely coexist, catering to
                    different use cases and preferences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In conclusion, immutable distributions represent a promising
                    evolution of Linux operating systems, emphasizing security,
                    reliability, and ease of maintenance. Whether they become
                    the standard or remain a niche choice depends on individual
                    needs and priorities. Immutable distributions offer an
                    alternative approach to Linux, one that can be better suited
                    to specific scenarios but may not be the right fit for
                    everyone.

                    its big plan to force devs to pay more when they succeed.
                    Unity said it was “listening” to the critique, adding it

                    Unity’s plans to skim additional money off the top from
                    Unity developers did not exactly engender goodwill with the
                    people who put the software to use. Those subscribing to the
                    cheaper Unity Personal or Unity Plus plans would have been
                    forced to pay $.20 for every game installed past the
                    threshold. Those larger companies paying more would have to
                    fork over between $.02 and $.125 for every install.
                    <em>Rust</em> developer Garry Newman, who developed his game
                    in Unity nearly 10 years ago,

                    his Facepunch Studios would owe the company $410,000 based
                    on the number of installs.

                    showed that Unity would charge per install, even if it was
                    the same user simply re-installing the game, or installing
                    on a separate device.

                    [...] There’s no word on what changes Unity plans to make to
                    its fee structure, but for many devs, the damage is already
                    done. Newman wrote on his company’s

                    “We used the engine because you pay [upfront] and then ship
                    your product,” Newman wrote. “We weren’t told this was going
                    to happen. We weren’t warned. We weren’t consulted… We can
                    see what they can and are willing to do. You can’t un-ring
                    that bell.”

                    A cyber criminal gang proficient in impersonation and
                    malware has been identified as the likely culprit for an
                    attack that paralized networks at US casino operator MGM

                    The group, which security researchers call "Scattered
                    Spider," uses fraudulent phone calls to employees and help
                    desks to "phish" for login credentials. It has targeted MGM
                    and dozens of other Western companies with the aim of
                    extracting ransom payments, according to two people familiar
                    with the situation.

                    including the Bellagio, Aria, Cosmopolitan, and Excalibur,
                    preemptively shut down large parts of its internal networks
                    after discovering the breach on Sunday, one of the people

                    Chandrayaan means "moon vehicle" in Hindi and Sanskrit. The
                    vehicle took off from a launch pad in southern India on July
                    14 and completed a 'soft landing' on the moon nine days
                    later. A soft landing is when the space shuttle is kept
                    intact.

                  <p>
                    Attempts by various space agencies have been made to land on
                    the south pole of the moon, but it's notoriously difficult
                    to do, thanks to rugged terrain, extreme temperatures, lack
                    of light and communication difficulties.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Humans have been landing on the equator of the moon for
                    more than half a century," says Dr. McKemmish. "And while a
                    soft landing is always more technical, when the landscape is
                    more cratered, such as it is at the south pole, that landing
                    becomes even harder. There's also increased complexities
                    with communication at the poles, compared to the equator."

                    Chandrayaan–3 will be running a series of experiments
                    including a spectrometer analysis of the mineral composition
                    of the lunar surface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Generally a moon rover will be digging up samples, taking
                    lots of photos, and taking various spectral readings
                    investigating how the material interacts with light," says
                    Dr. McKemmish.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "For this mission, the spectroscopic technique used is
                    basically focusing a laser on the surface, causing the moon
                    rocks to become a plasma. This plasma emits colors of light
                    depending on its composition and thus this measurement tells
                    us a lot about the geology and history of the rock."

                    In a controversial bid to expose supposed bias in a top
                    journal, a US climate expert shocked fellow scientists by
                    revealing he tailored a wildfire study to emphasize global
                    warming.
                  </p>

                    While supporters applauded Patrick T. Brown for flagging
                    what he called a one-sided climate "narrative" in academic
                    publishing, his move surprised at least one of his
                    co-authors—and angered the editors of leading journal
                    <i>Nature</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I left out the full truth to get my climate change paper
                    published," read the headline to an article signed by Brown
                    in the news site The Free Press on September 5.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He said he deliberately focused on the impact from higher
                    temperatures on wildfire risk in a study in the journal,
                    excluding other factors such as land management.

                    in <i>Nature</i> because I stuck to a narrative I knew the
                    editors would like," the article read. "That's not the way
                    science should work."

                  <p>
                    One of the named co-authors of the study, Steven J. Davis, a
                    professor in the earth system science department at the
                    University of California, Irvine, told AFP Brown's comments
                    took him "by surprise".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Patrick may have made decisions that he thought would help
                    the paper be published, but we don't know whether a
                    different paper would have been rejected," he said in an
                    email.

                    felt like he had to be a willing participant in

                    that long run, that is not a service to him, the field, or

                    Browsing the Asian marketplaces online is always an
                    experience. Sometimes, you see things at ridiculously low
                    prices. Other times, you see things and wonder who is buying
                    them and why — a shrimp pillow? But sometimes, you see
                    something that probably could have a more useful purpose
                    than the proposed use case.

                    [...] The good news for some, at least: it likely poses a
                    minimal threat to most people, considering the
                    multi-million-dollar price tag and other requirements for
                    developing a surveillance campaign using Sherlock, Kelley
                    noted.

                  <p>
                    Still, "it's just one more way that spyware companies can
                    surveil and target activists, reporters, and government
                    officials," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Data finds its way to being used for surveillance,
                    and worse, all the time," he continued. "Stop making the
                    data collection profitable, and this goes away. If
                    behavioral advertising were banned, the industry wouldn't
                    exist."

                    California has become the third US state to pass a
                    right-to-repair bill for consumer electronics. After a
                    unanimous vote in favor, Sacramento lawmakers expect
                    Governor Gavin Newsom to sign the bill into law.

                    >. It stipulates that for electronics costing between $50
                    and $100, manufacturers must provide consumers and
                    independent repair shops with replacement parts and repair
                    manuals for three years after the initial manufacture date.
                    That timespan extends to seven years for devices costing
                    over $100. Although the law goes into effect on July 1,
                    2024, it applies retroactively to products manufactured
                    after July 1, 2021.

                  <p>
                    The law mainly applies to devices like phones, tablets,
                    laptops, and other general-purpose appliances, but not alarm
                    systems or video game consoles. Although manufacturers
                    extracted fewer concessions in California than Minnesota or
                    New York, a few significant ones remain.

                  <p>
                    First, the bill doesn't require companies to provide
                    instructions for bypassing security measures, which can
                    often prove a significant obstacle to independent repairs.

                    is notorious for using software locks to force users to
                    spend extra money on first-party maintenance and

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another caveat to the California bill is that independent
                    repair vendors must disclose when they use refurbished
                    replacement parts or originate components from third-party
                    makers. This condition could affect how companies handle
                    issues such as official repairs or warranties.

                    After spending decades on pharmacy shelves, the leading
                    nasal decongestant in over-the-counter cold and allergy
                    medicines has met its downfall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Advisers for the Food and Drug Administration this week
                    voted unanimously, 16 to 0, that oral doses of
                    phenylephrine—found in brand-name products like Sudafed PE,
                    Benadryl Allergy Plus Congestion, Mucinex Sinus-Max, and
                    Nyquil Severe Cold &amp; Flu—are not effective at treating a
                    stuffy nose.

                  <p>
                    The vote was years in the making. In 2007, amid doubts, FDA
                    advisers called for more studies. With the data that has
                    trickled in since then, the agency's own scientists
                    conducted a careful review and came to the firm conclusion

                    Schumer, who has made AI one of his top issues as leader,
                    said regulation of artificial intelligence will be "one of
                    the most difficult issues we can ever take on," and he
                    listed some of the reasons why: It's technically
                    complicated, it keeps changing and it "has such a wide,
                    broad effect across the whole world," he said.

                    Sparked by the release of ChatGPT less than a year ago,
                    businesses have been clamoring to apply new generative AI
                    tools that can compose human-like passages of text, program
                    computer code and create novel images, audio and video. The
                    hype over such tools has accelerated worries over its
                    potential societal harms and prompted calls for more
                    transparency in how the data behind the new products is
                    collected and used.

                    Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who led the
                    meeting with Schumer, said Congress needs to get ahead of
                    fast-moving AI by making sure it continues to develop "on
                    the positive side" while also taking care of potential
                    issues surrounding data transparency and privacy.

                  <p>
                    "AI is not going away, and it can do some really good things
                    or it can be a real challenge," Rounds said.

                    The tech leaders and others outlined their views at the
                    meeting, with each participant getting three minutes to
                    speak on a topic of their choosing. Schumer and Rounds then
                    led a group discussion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During the discussion, according to attendees who spoke
                    about it, Musk and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt raised
                    existential risks posed by AI, and Zuckerberg brought up the
                    question of closed vs. "open source" AI models. Gates talked
                    about feeding the hungry. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna expressed
                    opposition to proposals favored by other companies that
                    would require licenses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In terms of a potential new agency for regulation, "that is
                    one of the biggest questions we have to answer and that we
                    will continue to discuss," Schumer said. Musk said afterward
                    he thinks the creation of a regulatory agency is likely.

                    Outside the meeting, Google CEO Pichai declined to give
                    details about specifics but generally endorsed the idea of
                    Washington involvement.

                    "I think it's important that government plays a role, both
                    on the innovation side and building the right safeguards,
                    and I thought it was a productive discussion," he said.

                    Some senators were critical that the public was shut out of
                    the meeting, arguing that the tech executives should testify
                    in public.

                    Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he would not attend what he
                    said was a "giant cocktail party for big tech." Hawley has
                    introduced legislation with Sen. Richard Blumenthal,
                    D-Conn., to require tech companies to seek licenses for
                    high-risk AI systems.

                    "I don't know why we would invite all the biggest
                    monopolists in the world to come and give Congress tips on
                    how to help them make more money and then close it to the

                    While civil rights and labor groups were also represented at
                    the meeting, some experts worried that Schumer's event
                    risked emphasizing the concerns of big firms over everyone
                    else.

                    Sarah Myers West, managing director of the nonprofit AI Now
                    Institute, estimated that the combined net worth of the room
                    Wednesday was $550 billion and it was "hard to envision a
                    room like that in any way meaningfully representing the
                    interests of the broader public." She did not attend.

                  <p>
                    In the United States, major tech companies have expressed
                    support for AI regulations, though they don't necessarily
                    agree on what that means. Similarly, members of Congress
                    agree that legislation is needed, but there is little
                    consensus on what to do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is also division, with some members of Congress
                    worrying more about overregulation of the industry while
                    others are concerned more about the potential risks. Those
                    differences often fall along party lines.

                and many other places, the 2023 Ig Nobel winners have been
                announced.

                The Ig Nobel Prize celebrates the most trivial and ridiculous
                things our best and brightest have studied. The 2023 award
                winners are now world-class experts that have advanced mankind's
                knowledge on big questions. Questions like "how much do horny
                anchovies influence ocean water mixing?" Or "if a group of
                people stand in the street looking upward, does the size of the
                group influence how many unrelated passers-by also decide to
                look up?" Or that old chestnut, "do we need toilets that analyze
                our excreta and identify us by taking photos of our anuses?"
              </p>
              <p>
                Just a couple of examples to raise the level of excitement...

                    For hundreds of years, we have been told what Newton's First
                    Law of Motion supposedly says, but recently a paper
                    published in Philosophy of Science (preprint) by [Daniel
                    Hoek] argues that it is based on a mistranslation of the
                    original Latin text. As noted by [Stephanie Pappas] in
                    Scientific American, this would seem to be a rather academic
                    matter as Newton's Laws of Motion have been superseded by
                    General Relativity and other theories developed over the
                    intervening centuries. Yet even today Newton's theories are
                    highly relevant, as they provide very accessible
                    approximations for predicting phenomena on Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Similarly, we owe it to scientific and historical accuracy
                    to address such matters, all of which seem to come down to
                    an awkward translation of Isaac Newton's original Latin text
                    in the 1726 third edition to English by Andrew Motte in
                    1729. This English translation is what ended up defining for
                    countless generations what Newton's Laws of Motion said,
                    along with the other chapters in his Philosophiæ Naturalis
                    Principia Mathematica.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1999 a new translation (Cohen-Whitman translation) was
                    published by a team of translators, which contains a number
                    of notable departures from the 1729 translation. Most
                    notable herein is the change of the original (Motte)
                    translation:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of
                        uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled
                        to change that state by forces impress'd thereon.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>to the following in the Cohen-Whitman translation:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        Every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or
                        of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as
                        it is compelled to change its state by the forces
                        impressed.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    This more correct translation of the Latin nisi quatenus has
                    significant implications for the law's effects, as while
                    Newton's version does not require force-free bodies, the
                    weak reading introduced by Motte's translation incites
                    exactly the kind of debate which has been seen over the
                    centuries about why the First Law even exists, when in this
                    translated form it automatically follows from the Second
                    Law, rendering it redundant.

                    The three-judge appeals panel said nine of the lower court's
                    ten prohibitions were vague and overly broad at this stage
                    of the litigation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Prohibitions one, two, three, four, five, and seven
                    prohibit the officials from engaging in, essentially, any
                    action 'for the purpose of urging, encouraging, pressuring,
                    or inducing' content moderation," the appeals panel said.
                    "But 'urging, encouraging, pressuring' or even 'inducing'
                    action does not violate the Constitution unless and until
                    such conduct crosses the line into coercion or significant
                    encouragement."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And citing problems with prohibitions eight, nine and ten,
                    they vacated all save for the sixth, which they modified to
                    state that government officials or their agents can take "no
                    actions, formal or informal, directly or indirectly, to
                    coerce or significantly encourage social-media companies to
                    remove, delete, suppress, or reduce, including through
                    altering their algorithms, posted social-media content
                    containing protected free speech."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not all speech in the US is protected, so this injunction –
                    in place while the case is being heard – does not apply to
                    government communication to social media companies about:
                    incitement to imminent unlawful action; harassment; credible

                    [...] "The court said it is impermissible for the government

                    social media censorship laws did. They literally overrode
                    the social media companies' editorial discretion via
                    government edict.

                    "And thus, the Fifth Circuit, the same court,

                    those interventions, saying that was constitutionally
                    permissible for the government to dictate content moderation
                    operations. In other words, this opinion is in
                    irreconcilable tension with the Fifth Circuit's earlier
                    opinion on the social media censorship laws."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Also, Goldman observed that the Fifth Circuit seems to be
                    saying that these social media companies risk becoming state
                    actors by engaging with government officials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, with regard to platform cooperation in limiting
                    health misinformation, there's passage in the opinion that
                    says, "In sum, we find that the White House officials, in
                    conjunction with the Surgeon General's office, coerced and
                    significantly encouraged the platforms to moderate content.
                    As a result, the platforms’ actions 'must in law be deemed
                    to be that of the State.'"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "That's a huge problem for the government," he continued.
                    "If internet companies become state actors, then they cannot
                    report information about their users to law enforcement
                    unless they comply with all the laws on criminal procedure."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As an example, Goldman cited how the government requires
                    internet services to provide data about child sexual abuse
                    material. If those companies become state actors through
                    government intervention, he said, then those reports become
                    impermissible evidence because they haven't been done in
                    compliance with legal rules that constrain the government.

                    The modus operandi entailed establishing a reverse shell to
                    an actor-controlled server and installing a Bash stealer on
                    the compromised system. The campaign, which took place

                    The website in question is freedownloadmanager[.]org, which,
                    according to the Russian cybersecurity firm, offers a
                    legitimate Linux software called "Free Download Manager,"
                    but starting in January 2020, began redirecting some users
                    who attempted to download it to another domain
                    deb.fdmpkg[.]org that served a booby-trapped Debian package.

                    It's suspected that the malware authors engineered the
                    attack based on certain predefined filtering criteria (say,
                    a digital fingerprint of the system) to selectively lead
                    potential victims to the malicious version. The rogue
                    redirects ended in 2022 for inexplicable reasons.

                    [...] It's not immediately clear how the compromise actually
                    took place and what the end goals of the campaign were.
                    What's evident is that not everyone who downloaded the
                    software received the rogue package, enabling it to evade
                    detection for years.

                    "While the campaign is currently inactive, this case of Free
                    Download Manager demonstrates that it can be quite difficult
                    to detect ongoing cyberattacks on Linux machines with the
                    naked eye," the researchers said.

                    [...] Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar previously made comments
                    during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that any
                    kind of pause on AI development would mean that China could
                    get the better of the U.S. in technological supremacy. He
                    was adamant that the U.S. spend even more of its defense
                    budget by investing even more money on “capabilities that
                    will terrify our adversaries.”

                    thanks to the build up of biofilms: a consortium of

                    instance. These microbial or fungal growths can clog filters
                    in water processing systems and make astronauts sick.

                    between researchers at the University of Colorado, MIT and
                    the NASA Ames Research Center, researchers studied samples
                    from the space station using a specific and well-understood
                    gram-negative kind of bacteria. The scientists also joined
                    forces with experts at
                    <a href="https://liquiglide.com/">LiquiGlide</a>, a company
                    run by MIT researcher Kripa Varanasi that specializes in
                    “eliminating the friction between solids and liquids.” The
                    multidisciplinary study found covering surfaces with a thin
                    layer of nucleic acids prevented bacterial growth on the
                    ISS-exposed samples.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The scientists concluded that these acids carried a slight
                    negative electric charge that stopped microbes from sticking
                    to surfaces. It's worth noting though, that the bacteria
                    were up against a unique physical barrier as well as a
                    chemical one: testing surfaces were etched into "nanograss."
                    These silicon spikes, which resembled a tiny forest, were
                    then slicked with a silicon oil, creating a slippery surface
                    which biofilms struggled to adhere to.

                    meter. It showed a difference between players who made
                    choices simply to maximise their morality score, and others

                    quantitative data on morality meters. The results show the
                    meter is generally ignored when a moral choice is
                    straightforward, but it can influence decisions when the
                    choice is morally ambiguous.

                    [...] "You know someone's going to get hurt," Yu said. "In
                    the paper we argue that when the victim is more salient, the
                    association between the guilt trait and corrupt behavior
                    becomes stronger." Concern for others' suffering, they said,
                    might play a significant role in how guilt-proneness
                    influences bribe-taking behaviors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Indeed, the researchers say, guilt proneness is not
                    the only trait that might predict corrupt behaviors (or lack
                    of them), and it's worth studying how this trait, along with
                    other personality traits, might "serve as a reliable
                    anti-corruption predictor in personnel selection," such as
                    when choosing people for leadership positions or for
                    high-stakes jobs.

                    "We can't claim causality, but we can leverage the
                    association between the guilt trait and the lower likelihood
                    of corruption to make us more confident about their
                    integrity," Yu said. "Maybe that's something we can apply to
                    the real world."

                    The water coming out of your faucet is safe to drink, but
                    that doesn't mean it's completely clean. Chlorine has long
                    been the standard for water treatment, but it often contains
                    trace levels of disinfection byproducts and unknown
                    contaminants. Georgia Institute of Technology researchers
                    developed the minus approach to handle these harmful
                    byproducts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead of relying on traditional chemical addition (known
                    as the plus approach), the minus approach avoids
                    disinfectants, chemical coagulants, and advanced oxidation
                    processes typical to water treatment processes. It uses a
                    unique mix of filtration methods to remove byproducts and
                    pathogens, enabling water treatment centers to use
                    ultraviolet light and much smaller doses of chemical
                    disinfectants to minimize future bacterial growth down the
                    distribution system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The minus approach is a groundbreaking philosophical
                    concept in water treatment," said Yongsheng Chen, the Bonnie
                    W. and Charles W. Moorman IV Professor in the School of
                    Civil and Environmental Engineering. "Its primary objective
                    is to achieve these outcomes while minimizing the reliance
                    on chemical treatments, which can give rise to various
                    issues in the main water treatment stream."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chen and his student Elliot Reid, the primary author,
                    presented
                    <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c09389"
                      >the minus approach</a
                    >
                    in the paper, "The Minus Approach Can Redefine the Standard
                    of Practice of Drinking Water Treatment," in the
                    <i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</i> journal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The minus approach physically separates emerging
                    contaminants and disinfection byproducts from the main water
                    treatment process using these already proven processes:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The minus approach is intended to engage the water community
                    in designing safer, more sustainable, and more intelligent
                    systems. Because its technologies are already available and
                    proven, the minus approach can be implemented immediately.

                    The main feature of the new specification is its ability to

                    simultaneously receiving data at up to 40 Gbps. The mode,

                    Turchin, however, now holds a different view. Increasing
                    evidence suggested that "simple" Neolithic farmers'
                    societies also collapsed. "In fact, such cases are much more
                    profound than the social and political breakdown of more
                    recent societies, because archaeology indicates that

                    organization during this time, it would be easy to imagine
                    that things were static, such that people settled in a
                    village and lived there for three or four thousand years
                    without much happening in between. That doesn't seem to be
                    the case. Sadly, this also means that this period was more
                    violent than previously thought."

                    complex system, regardless of their political or economic
                    organization. It doesn't matter if you don't want to

                    has reported that even though the components for Apple's
                    chips will be manufactured in the US, they'll still have to
                    be sent back to TSMC's home country for assembly.

                    Apparently, the manufacturer's factory in Arizona doesn't
                    have the facilities to package its customers' more advanced
                    chips. "Packaging" is what you call the final stage of
                    fabrication, wherein the chip's components are assembled
                    inside a housing as close together as possible to enhance
                    speed and power efficiency. The iPhone, in particular, has
                    been using a packaging method developed by TSMC since 2016.
                    Chips for iPads and Macs can be packaged outside of Taiwan,
                    but the iPhone's will have to be assembled in the country.

                    boost chip packaging in the US, it's aware of the need to
                    bring the process into the country, as well. Apple and all
                    the aforementioned TSMC clients aren't the only companies
                    whose chips have to be sent overseas for assembly, since
                    manufacturers aren't making enough products in the US to
                    justify building packaging facilities in the country.
                    However, that program is only getting $2.5 billion in
                    funding under the CHIPS Act, and the Institute of Printed
                    Circuits told the publication that the amount shows
                    packaging isn't being prioritized. As for TSMC,
                    <em>The Information's</em> sources said it has no plans to
                    build packaging facilities in the US due to the huge costs
                    involved, and any future packaging method it develops will
                    most likely be offered in Taiwan.

                    [...] But CTE is preventable. Small changes to practice
                    drills and gameplay could make a huge difference for young
                    athletes, says Nowinski. The playbook for prevention is
                    simple: Reduce the number of hits to the head, and reduce
                    the strength of those hits. Most happen during practice, so
                    by reducing the number of drills involving head impacts and
                    choosing ones that are less likely to cause high-magnitude
                    blows, coaches can spare their players unnecessary danger.
                    "You can't get rid of CTE in tackling sports," adds
                    Nowinski, "but you can get rid of most cases of CTE."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Reducing the length of each game and the number of games per
                    season can minimize the likelihood of head injuries, and
                    banning brain-jostling events, like fighting in hockey or
                    heading in soccer, can make games safer, he continues.
                    Perhaps most importantly, youth sports leagues can raise the
                    age at which kids are first exposed to preventable head
                    impacts. "With tackle football before 14, the risks are not
                    worth the benefits," Nowinski says. "You don't become a
                    better football player from playing young." In one case
                    study reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and
                    Prevention, transitioning from tackle to flag football would
                    reduce a young athlete's median number of head impacts per
                    season from 378 to eight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But, Nowinski points out, there is no central governing body
                    in charge of youth sports leagues, leaving it largely up to
                    individual coaches to make changes to their practice drills
                    and recruitment strategies. "The opportunity is right in
                    front of our faces," says Nowinski. "I remember being told
                    how much football makes you a leader. But right now, on this
                    issue, there's a black hole of leadership."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    McKee doesn't think that parents should take their kids out
                    of sports—far from it. "We just need to change the rules and
                    our thinking about these games, so that CTE isn't a
                    consequence of playing contact sports," McKee says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And for young athletes concerned about CTE, she urges them
                    to seek help for mental health symptoms, build personal
                    support systems, and keep moving forward with their lives.
                    "Individuals like Evan need to be seen, because in all
                    likelihood, we can treat their symptoms and help them feel
                    less hopeless," she says. "It's not a time to despair. It's
                    a time to come in, be evaluated, and be treated."

                    A team of planetary scientists at Arizona State University
                    has found evidence that the multitude of bright flashes in
                    Venus' atmosphere may be due to meteors passing through, not
                    lightning strikes. In their paper published in
                    <i>Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets,</i> the group
                    describes their study of the flashes of light and what they
                    learned about them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists studying Venus have noted periodic flashes of
                    light in its atmosphere for many years. For most of that
                    time the flashes have been attributed to lightning flashing
                    through the planet's atmosphere. Probes sent to the planet
                    have done little to confirm the origin of the flashes—bursts
                    of electromagnetic static have been recorded, which have
                    been likened to the type heard during thunderstorms on
                    Earth, suggesting lightning as a likely source.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But there has also been a sticking point—recorded bursts of
                    static and images of a light flashing through the atmosphere
                    have never been observed happening at the same time. Also,
                    there is little evidence showing that Venus' atmosphere is
                    capable of producing lightning. Such issues led the
                    researchers on this new effort to consider another
                    source—meteors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In comparing the number of flashes recorded in Venus'
                    atmosphere with the number of possible meteor strikes, the
                    team found them to be close enough to suggest that they
                    could be related. More research is required, but if the
                    initial findings turn out to be correct, space agencies will
                    breathe a sigh of relief—sending a probe through clouds
                    laden with lightning strikes is far more difficult than one
                    where the skies are occasionally lit up by meteors.

                    cruising across highways is one of those tempting technocrat
                    ideas that doesn't look like it will pan out. As autonomous
                    driving technology matured in the middle of the last decade,
                    we saw trials of the concept, but human truck drivers do
                    more than just throttle, steer, and brake, and they aren't
                    likely to be replaced soon.

                    A better idea would be to shift some of that cargo to our
                    underutilized railways—here, the idea of platooning is an
                    old one, better known as a "train." Parallel Systems hopes
                    to do just that with its second-generation autonomous
                    battery-electric freight railcar.

                    For state-sponsored hacking operations, unpatched
                    vulnerabilities are valuable ammunition. Intelligence
                    agencies and militaries seize on hackable bugs when they're
                    revealed—exploiting them to carry out their campaigns of
                    espionage or cyberwar—or spend millions to dig up new ones
                    or to buy them in secret from the hacker gray market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But for the past two years, China has added another approach
                    to obtaining information about those vulnerabilities: a law
                    that simply demands that any network technology business
                    operating in the country hand it over. When tech companies
                    learn of a hackable flaw in their products, they're now
                    required to tell a Chinese government agency—which, in some
                    cases, then shares that information with China's
                    state-sponsored hackers, according to a new investigation.
                    And some evidence suggests foreign firms with China-based
                    operations are complying with the law, indirectly giving
                    Chinese authorities hints about potential new ways to hack
                    their own customers.

                    operating in China handle the discovery of security
                    vulnerabilities in tech products.<br />[...]<br />The
                    report's authors combed through the Chinese government's own
                    descriptions of that program to chart the complex path the
                    vulnerability information then takes: The data is shared
                    with several other government bodies, including China's
                    National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical
                    Teams/Coordination Center, or CNCERT/CC, an agency devoted
                    to defending Chinese networks. But the researchers found
                    that CNCERT/CC makes its reports available to technology
                    "partners" that include exactly the sort of Chinese
                    organizations devoted not to fixing security vulnerabilities
                    but to exploiting them. One such partner is the Beijing
                    bureau of China's Ministry of State Security, the agency
                    responsible for
