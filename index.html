                    So, the researchers examined whether EVs extracted from
                    cow's milk could be used as a means of delivering drugs to
                    the problematic gastrointestinal tract. Milk EVs (mEVs) have
                    <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/9/2589"
                      >previously been investigated</a
                    >
                    for their therapeutic potential in irritable bowel disease
                    (IBD) in mouse models.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After they'd confirmed that the mEVs crossed the intestinal
                    wall using realistic organoid models of human intestines,
                    the researchers loaded the mEVs with anti-tumor necrosis
                    factor alpha (anti-TNF-a) RNA and administered a single dose
                    to a rat model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). TNF-a
                    mediates the intestinal inflammatory process and is one of
                    the main factors implicated in the development of IBD. The
                    treatment reduced the length of a major site of colon
                    inflammation in the rats compared to controls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The significant improvement in the appearance of the colon
                    in the treated group suggested that mEVs successfully
                    delivered functional anti-TNF-a RNA cargo, thereby reducing
                    inflammation and promoting repair of the colon wall.
                    Although the study only considered the effect of RNA-loaded
                    mEVs on IBD, the researchers say the mEVs could be used to
                    treat a broad range of diseases, including heart diseases
                    and diabetes, using orally administered therapeutics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This could lead to the disruptive and sustainable
                    manufacturing of affordable and accessible oral nucleic acid
                    therapies for a plethora of diseases, leading to great
                    societal impacts," Vllasaliu said.

                    to legally share emulated versions of their physical game
                    collections with researchers remotely over the Internet. But
                    those preservationists continue to face pushback from
                    industry trade groups, who worry that an exemption would
                    open a legal loophole for "online arcades" that could give
                    members of the public free, legal, and widespread access to
                    copyrighted classic games.

                    defended their proposal for a system of "individualized
                    human review" to help ensure that temporary remote game
                    access would be granted "primarily for the purposes of

                      href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/87-of-classic-games-are-out-of-print-thats-a-problem-for-gaming-history/"

                    >
                    that found a whopping 87 percent of games ever released are
                    out of print, making it difficult for researchers to get
                    access to huge swathes of video game history without
                    institutional help. And the games of most interest to
                    researchers are less likely to have had modern re-releases,
                    since they tend to be the "more primitive" early games with
                    "less popular appeal," Salvador said.

                    The Copyright Office is expected to rule on the preservation
                    community's proposed exemption later this year. But for the
                    moment, there is some frustration that the industry has not
                    been at all receptive to the significant compromises the
                    preservation community feels it has made on these potential
                    concerns.

                    As Seagate ramps up shipments of its new heat assisted
                    magnetic recording (HAMR)-based

                      >Mozaic 3+ hard drive platform</a
                    >, the company is both in the enviable position of shipping
                    the first major new hard drive technology in a decade, and
                    the much less enviable position of proving the reliability
                    of the first major new hard drive technology in a decade.
                    Due to HAMR's use of temporal heating with its platters, as
                    well as all-new read/write heads, HAMR introduces multiple
                    new changes at once that have raise questions about how
                    reliable the technology will be. Looking to address these
                    matters (and further promote their HAMR drives),
                    <a

                      >Seagate has published a fresh blog post</a
                    >
                    outlining the company's R&amp;D efforts, and why the company
                    expects their HAMR drives to last several years – as long or
                    longer than current PMR hard drives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the company, the reliability of Mozaic 3+
                    drives on par with traditional drives relying on
                    perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR), the company says. In
                    fact, components of HAMR HDDs have demonstrated a 50%
                    increase in reliability over the past two years. Seagate
                    says that Mozaic 3+ drives boast impressive durability
                    metrics: their read/write heads have demonstrated capacity
                    to handle over 3.2 petabytes of data transfer over 6,000
                    hours of operation, which exceeds data transfers of typical
                    nearline hard drives by 20 times. Accordingly, Seagate is
                    rating these drives for a mean time between failure (MTBF)
                    2.5 million hours, which is in-line with PMR-based drives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Based on their field stress tests, involving over 500,000
                    Mozaic 3+ drives, Seagate says that the heads of Mozaic 3+
                    drives will last over seven years, surpassing the typical
                    lifespan of current PMR-based drives. Generally, customers
                    anticipate that modern PMR drives will last between four and
                    five years with average usage, so these drives would exceed
                    current expectations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Altogether, Seagate is continuing aim for a seamless
                    transition from PMR to HAMR drives in customer systems. That
                    means ensuring that these new drives can fit into existing
                    data center infrastructures without requiring any changes to
                    enterprise specifications, warranty conditions, or form
                    factors.

                    A huge heart-shaped feature on the surface of Pluto has
                    intrigued astronomers since NASA's New Horizons spacecraft
                    captured it in a 2015 image. Now, researchers think they
                    have solved the mystery of how the distinctive heart came to
                    be — and it could reveal new clues about the dwarf planet's
                    origins.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The feature is called Tombaugh Regio in honor of astronomer
                    Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered Pluto in 1930. But the heart
                    is not all one element, scientists say. And for decades,
                    details on Tombaugh Regio's elevation, geological
                    composition and distinct shape, as well as its highly
                    reflective surface that is a brighter white than the rest of
                    Pluto, have defied explanation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Through new research on Sputnik Planitia, an
                    international team of scientists has determined that a
                    cataclysmic event created the heart. After an analysis
                    involving numerical simulations, the researchers concluded a
                    planetary body about 435 miles (700 kilometers) in diameter,
                    or roughly twice the size of Switzerland from east to west,
                    likely collided with Pluto early in the dwarf planet's
                    history.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Pluto's core is so cold that the (rocky body that
                    collided with the dwarf planet) remained very hard and did
                    not melt despite the heat of the impact, and thanks to the
                    angle of impact and the low velocity, the core of the
                    impactor did not sink into Pluto's core, but remained intact
                    as a splat on it," said lead study author Dr. Harry
                    Ballantyne, research associate at the University of Bern in
                    Switzerland, in a statement.

                    People are surprised to learn that Mari Murdock, 36, is a
                    professional game master, a role in which she organizes and
                    narrates tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons &amp;
                    Dragons.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "A lot of people don't see things like hobbies or artistic
                    endeavors as something that could generally make them
                    money," she tells CNBC Make It.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Admittedly, she didn't expect running D&amp;D games to turn
                    into a paying gig, either — at least at first: "It was just
                    a hobby I did with my friends in college."

                  <p>

                    she'd still be planning D&amp;D campaigns for friends,
                    reading game books or writing fiction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since hobbies can become side hustles, "it's important to
                    remember that creative work is work," she says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "I run about three games a week on a busy week," says
                    Murdock. Each ongoing game, including prep, takes about four
                    to five hours a week of her time.

                  <p>
                    She also helps run company events, like the largest game of

                      >according to Guinness World Records</a
                    >. The game was held at a mall in Provo, Utah, and
                    culminated in all 1,227 participants defeating an evil
                    wizard named Vecna in the final attack.

                    [...] Despite the fantastical elements of Dungeons &amp;
                    Dragons, Murdock says her interest in gaming has not been
                    discouraged by her church. In fact, "a lot of members of the
                    LDS church gravitate toward fantasy games," she says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Attitudes have change since the

                  <p>
                    For Murdock, gaming allows you to immerse yourself in "a
                    pretend situation where you are imagining that you are
                    someone else. I think that really develops creativity. It
                    creates problem solving and a lot of empathy."

                  <p>Patricia was flying with her daughter, Kris.</p>
                  <p>
                    But it appears the airport computer system is unable to
                    process a birth date so far in the past - so it defaulted to
                    one 100 years later instead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The former nurse, who flies every year to see family and
                    escape the cold winters, says on both occasions staff at
                    American Airlines were kind and helpful, in spite of the
                    confusion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    American Airlines has not responded to a request for
                    comment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The centenarian says she would like it to be fixed. On a
                    previous flight, Patricia and her daughter were waiting
                    inside the plane after other passengers had left, as airport
                    staff had not arranged a wheelchair for her.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She says having her real age acknowledged would also be
                    beneficial for Kris.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I would like them to fix the computer as my poor daughter
                    had to carry all our luggage and apparel almost a mile from
                    one gate to the other," she said.
                  </p>
                  <p>Next trip</p>
                  <p>
                    Patricia travelled solo until she was 97, but has been
                    reliant on help from her family since then.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I have some trouble with my eyesight now so I wouldn't want
                    to do it on my own," she said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But she is adamant the IT problems will not put her off
                    flying, and says she is looking forward to her next flight
                    in the autumn.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By then she will be 102 - and perhaps by then the airline
                    computers will have caught on to her real age.

                    NEW YORK (AP) — An emergency slide fell off a Delta Air
                    Lines jetliner shortly after takeoff Friday from New York,
                    and pilots who felt a vibration in the plane circled back to
                    land safely at JFK Airport.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Delta said that after takeoff the pilots got an alert about
                    the emergency slide on the plane's right side and heard an
                    unusual sound coming from that area of the Boeing 767 jet,
                    which is listed as having been manufactured in 1990.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Federal Aviation Administration said the crew reported a
                    vibration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pilots declared an emergency so the flight could be be
                    routed quickly back to the airport, and the plane landed and
                    taxied to a gate under its own power, according to the
                    airline.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There were 176 passengers, two pilots and five flight
                    attendants on board the flight, which was scheduled to fly
                    to Los Angeles. Delta said it put passengers on another
                    plane to California.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Delta said the plane was removed from service for evaluation
                    and it was cooperating with investigators and supporting
                    efforts to find the slide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "As nothing is more important than the safety of our
                    customers and people, Delta flight crews enacted their
                    extensive training and followed procedures to return to
                    JFK," the airline said in a statement.

                    Meta's shares tumbled after company boss Mark Zuckerberg
                    said the quiet bit out loud: it will take a while before AI
                    bets start paying back the huge financial investments it is
                    making.

                      href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx"

                    for the first calendar quarter of 2024 looked promising.
                    Revenue was up 27 percent year-on-year to $36.5 billion,
                    operating profit almost doubled, climbing 91 percent to
                    $13.8 billion, and operating margin jumped from 25 percent
                    to 38 percent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Analysts would also normally have looked kindly upon the 10
                    percent drop in headcount, down to 69,329 by March 31, 2024.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, an otherwise rosy set of results was blighted first
                    by the admission that Meta expects losses from its VR
                    division, Reality Labs, to continue increasing – the
                    operating loss was $3.8 billion for Q1 – and capital
                    expenditure for 2024 is to increase from between $30-$37
                    billion to $35-$40 billion "as we continue to accelerate our
                    infrastructure investments to support our artificial
                    intelligence (AI) roadmap."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It was not what analysts wanted to hear, and the
                    company's stock was pummeled in after-hours trading. Having
                    closed at $493.50, it stood at $424.56 at the time of
                    writing, a fall of more than 14 percent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other companies in the tech sector have bet big on AI, and
                    the hype around the technology has become relentless.
                    Microsoft, for example, has poured billions into OpenAI and
                    crowbarred the technology into many of its products, and is
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/18/microsoft_copilot_moneymaker/"

                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] That said, Meta does have a particular set of
                    problems. The CEO pointed out that it usually takes a while
                    for the company to monetize a new product, which is fair
                    enough until considering the ongoing losses from Meta's
                    <a

                  <p>
                    The Metaverse gamble has yet to pay off. The drop in value
                    after the results could be an early sign that investors are
                    unwilling to wait too long for AI revenues to come close to
                    promises.

                    While the bulk of attention on TSMC is aimed at its
                    leading-edge nodes, such as N3E and N2, loads of chips will
                    continue to be made using more mature and proven process
                    technologies for years to come. Which is why TSMC has
                    continued to refine its existing nodes, including its
                    current-generation 5nm-class offerings. To that end, at its
                    North American Technology Symposium 2024, the company
                    introduced a new, optimized 5nm-class node: N4C.

                  <p>
                    [...] "This is a very significant enhancement, we are
                    working with our customer, basically to extract more value
                    from their 4 nm investment," Zhang said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    TSMC expects to start volume production of N4C chips some
                    time next year. And with TSMC having produced 5nm-class for
                    nearly half a decade at that point, N4C should be able to
                    hit the ground running in terms of volume and yields.

                Athletic director used AI to frame principal with racist remarks
                in fake audio clip, police say<br />A high school athletic
                director in Maryland has been accused of using artificial
                intelligence to impersonate a principal on an audio recording
                that included racist and antisemitic comments, authorities said
                Thursday.
              </p>
              <p>
                Scott Shellenberger, the Baltimore County state's attorney, said
                the case appears to be one of the first of its kind nationwide
                involving artificial intelligence that his office was able to
                find.
              </p>
              <p>
                A professor from the University of Colorado-Denver told police
                that it "contained traces of AI-generated content with human
                editing after the fact, which added background noises for
                realism," court records stated.
              </p>
              <p>
                A second opinion from a professor at the University of
                California-Berkley told police that "multiple recordings were
                spliced together," according to the records.

                A Baltimore County detective found that Darien had used Large
                Language Models, such as OpenAI and Bingchat, which can "tell
                users what steps to take to create synthetic media," court
                documents stated.

                Over at his personal blog, Kevin Norman describes how he has
                modified his motorized standing desk to raise and lower on its
                own according to a schedule. His post
                <a href="https://kn100.me/desksniffer/"

                >
                goes into a fair amount of detail about how he went about wiring
                it up and the problems which arose and how he fixed them. The
                active part uses an ESP-32 based microcontroller to change the
                desk's height using the I²C protocol.

                    For those not familiar with hardware, I2C is the scheme by
                    which most circuits use for inter-chip communication. In my
                    desk controller, there is a microcontroller which writes
                    data to a LCD driver chip, which in turn lights the correct
                    segments on a 3 digit segmented LCD. How would I capture the
                    data though? Easy, I thought! All I had do to was hook up to
                    the same two pins the data sheet reported as being the i2c
                    pins along with the grounds of the standing desk controller
                    and my esp32, and I could then "sniff" the data that was
                    being sent across the i2c bus, decode it, and then use that
                    for something useful.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So away I went! I soldered two wires directly to the pins on
                    the chip that were marked as the data pins (I am deeply
                    sorry to anybody offended by my soldering job!), and
                    soldered a third wire to a ground point on the board. I then
                    connected those wires to an ESP32, and then went looking for
                    somebody elses code to try to sniff the i2c data to see if
                    this was even possible.

                He even designed and 3D-printed an enclosure for this
                modification. It played a surprising role in this.

                    The Federal Communications Commission voted 3–2 to impose
                    net neutrality rules today, restoring the common-carrier
                    regulatory framework enforced during the Obama era and then

                    The rules prohibit Internet service providers from blocking
                    and throttling lawful content and ban paid prioritization.

                    during the Obama era when judges upheld the FCC's ability to
                    regulate ISPs as common carriers under Title II of the

                    "The Internet in America has thrived in the absence of
                    1930s, command-and-control regulations by the government,"
                    Commissioner Brendan Carr said.

                  <p>
                    Carr, who spoke for more than half an hour, described how
                    the FCC's net neutrality decisions were allegedly swayed by
                    President Obama in 2015 and by President Biden this year.
                    "The FCC has never been able to come up with a credible
                    reason or policy rationale for Title II. It is all just
                    shifting sands, and that is because the agency is doing what
                    it's been told to do by the executive branch," Carr said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Carr also blamed judges for giving the FCC too much power.

                    in the rules that would let ISPs give faster speeds to
                    certain types of applications as long as application
                    providers don't have to pay for special treatment. They say
                    the FCC should explicitly prohibit ISPs from speeding up
                    applications instead of only enforcing a no-throttling rule
                    that forbids slowing applications down. Others say the rules

                    <a href="https://www.multicians.org/thvv/7094.html">CTSS</a>
                    was developed during 1963 and 64. I was at MIT on the
                    computer center staff at that time. After having written
                    dozens of commands for CTSS, I reached the stage where I
                    felt that commands should be usable as building blocks for
                    writing more commands, just like subroutine libraries.
                    Hence, I wrote "RUNCOM", a sort of shell driving the
                    execution of command scripts, with argument substitution.
                    The tool became instantly most popular, as it became
                    possible to go home in the evening while leaving behind long
                    runcoms executing overnight. It was quite neat for boring
                    and repetitive tasks such as renaming, moving, updating,
                    compiling, etc. whole directories of files for system and
                    application maintenance and monitoring.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the same vein, I also felt that commands should be usable
                    as library subroutines, or vice versa. This stemmed from my
                    practice (unique at the time) of writing CTSS commands in
                    <a href="https://www.multicians.org/mgm.html#MAD">MAD</a>
                    (Michigan Algorithm Decoder), a simplified Algol-like
                    language. It was much faster and the code was more
                    maintainable than the IBM 7094 assembly code. Since I needed
                    MAD friendly subroutine calls to access CTSS primitives, I
                    wrote in assembly code a battery of interface subroutines,
                    which very often mimicked CTSS basic command functions. Or I
                    wanted to make commands out of subroutines which handled
                    common chores. I felt it was an awkward duplication of
                    effort. However, I did not go further in the context of
                    CTSS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then in 64 came the Multics design time, in which I was not
                    much involved, because I had made it clear I wanted to
                    return to France in mid 65. However, this idea of using
                    commands somehow like a programming language was still in
                    the back of my mind. Christopher Strachey, a British
                    scientist, had visited MIT about that time, and his
                    macro-generator design appeared to me a very solid base for
                    a command language, in particular the techniques for quoting
                    and passing arguments. Without being invited on the subject,
                    I wrote a paper explaining how the Multics command language
                    could be designed with this objective. And I coined the word
                    "shell" to name it.

                the start of the works for the Brightline West High-Speed Rail
                Project. The 218-mile rail line will operate between Las Vegas,
                Nevada, and Rancho Cucamonga, California, and will be a fully
                electric, zero-emission system.

              <p>
                The high-speed train should average an 186 miles an hour speed,
                bringing the overland travel time between Las Vegas and Los
                Angeles down from 4 to 2 hours. To do so, 195 miles (315 km) of
                new track needs to be laid down to exacting standards, on the
                mid-shoulder of Interstate 15. There will be stations in Las
                Vegas, Victor Valley, Hesperia and Rancho Cucamonga, California.
                The line should be fully operational by 2028, in time for the
                Olympic Games.

                Funding, to the tune of 12 billion dollar, comes half from
                private industry, and half from the Federal Government ($6.5
                billion in grants and financing). An estimated 35,000 jobs,
                including 10,000 direct union construction jobs, and 1,000
                permanent jobs once the line is operational, are associated with
                the project initiated by Brightline, a company which already

                    Anyway, a few days beforehand on February 1 2019, Kristen
                    Gil, then Google's VP Business Finance Officer, had emailed
                    Shashi Thakur, then Google's VP of Engineering, Search and
                    Discover, saying that the ads team had been considering a
                    "code yellow" to "close the search gap [it was] seeing,"
                    vaguely referring to how critical that growth was to an
                    unnamed "company plan." To be clear, this email was in
                    response to Thakur stating that there is "nothing" that the
                    search team could do to operate at the fidelity of growth
                    that ads had demanded.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shashi forwarded the email to Gomes, asking if there was any
                    way to discuss this with Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, and
                    declaring that there was no way he'd sign up to a "high
                    fidelity" business metric for daily active users on search.
                    Thakur also said something that I've been thinking about
                    constantly since I read these emails: that there was a good
                    reason that Google's founders separated search from ads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On February 2, 2019, just one day later, Thakur and Gomes
                    shared their anxieties with Nick Fox, a Vice President of
                    Search and Google Assistant, entering a multiple-day-long
                    debate about Google's sudden lust for growth. The thread is
                    a dark window into the world of growth-focused tech, where
                    Thakur listed the multiple points of disconnection between
                    the ads and search teams, discussing how the search team
                    wasn't able to finely optimize engagement on Google without
                    "hacking engagement," a term that means effectively tricking
                    users into spending more time on a site, and that doing so
                    would lead them to "abandon work on efficient journeys." In
                    one email, Fox adds that there was a "pretty big disconnect
                    between what finance and ads want" and what search was
                    doing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When Gomes pushed back on the multiple requests for growth,
                    Fox added that all three of them were responsible for
                    search, that search was "the revenue engine of the company,"
                    and that bartering with the ads and finance teams was
                    potentially "the new reality of their jobs."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On February 6th 2019, Gomes said that he believed that
                    search was "getting too close to the money," and ended his
                    email by saying that he was "concerned that growth is all
                    that Google was thinking about."

                    This new finding shows that the vulnerability is far more
                    widespread than previously believed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The scale of this was really shocking to us," says
                    Wang. "And also, these are completely different
                    manufacturers making very similar mistakes independently of
                    one another, which is just absolutely shocking as well."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The massive scale of the problem is compounded by the fact
                    that these vulnerabilities aren't hard to exploit. "You
                    don't need huge supercomputers crunching numbers to crack
                    this. You don't need to collect terabytes of data to crack
                    it," says Knockel. "If you're just a person who wants to
                    target another person on your Wi-Fi, you could do that once
                    you understand the vulnerability."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] One potential cause of the loopholes' ubiquity is that
                    most of these keyboard apps were developed in the 2000s,
                    before the TLS protocol was commonly adopted in software
                    development. Even though the apps have been through numerous
                    rounds of updates since then, inertia could have prevented
                    developers from adopting a safer alternative.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The report points out that language barriers and different
                    tech ecosystems prevent English- and Chinese-speaking
                    security researchers from sharing information that could fix
                    issues like this more quickly. For example, because Google's
                    Play store is blocked in China, most Chinese apps are not
                    available in Google Play, where Western researchers often go
                    for apps to analyze.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sometimes all it takes is a little additional effort. After
                    two emails about the issue to iFlytek were met with silence,
                    the Citizen Lab researchers changed the email title to
                    Chinese and added a one-line summary in Chinese to the
                    English text. Just three days later, they received an email
                    from iFlytek, saying that the problem had been resolved.

                A GitHub flaw, or possibly a design decision, is being abused by

                    While most of the malware activity has been based around the
                    Microsoft GitHub URLs, this "flaw" could be abused with any
                    public repository on GitHub, allowing threat actors to
                    create very convincing lures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yesterday, McAfee released a report on a new

                    >
                    distributed through what appeared to be a legitimate
                    Microsoft GitHub repositories for the "C++ Library Manager
                    for Windows, Linux, and MacOS," known as
                    <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg">vcpkg</a>, and
                    the
                    <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL">STL library</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The URLs for the malware installers, shown below, clearly
                    indicate that they belong to the Microsoft repo, but we
                    could not find any reference to the files in the project's
                    source code.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finding it strange that a Microsoft repo would be
                    <a href="http://urlhaus.abuse.ch/url/2760438/"
                      >distributing malware since February</a
                    >, BleepingComputer looked into it and found that the files
                    are not part of vcpkg but were uploaded as part of a comment
                    left on a commit or issue in the project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As the file's URL contains the name of the repository
                    the comment was created in, and as almost every software
                    company uses GitHub, this flaw can allow threat actors to
                    develop extraordinarily crafty and trustworthy lures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, a threat actor could upload a malware
                    executable in
                    <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-installer"
                      >NVIDIA's driver installer repo</a
                    >
                    that pretends to be a new driver fixing issues in a popular
                    game. Or a threat actor could upload a file in a comment to
                    the
                    <a href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium"
                      >Google Chromium source code</a
                    >
                    and pretend it's a new test version of the web browser.

                    license. The office said that it will, going forward, check
                    that a spacecraft designed to return to Earth has a reentry
                    license as part of the standard payload review process.

                    [....] "Unlike typical payloads designed to operate in outer
                    space, a reentry vehicle has primary components that are
                    designed to withstand reentry substantially intact and
                    therefore have a near-guaranteed ground impact as a result
                    of either a controlled reentry or a random reentry,"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] "Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the safety of
                    the reentry prior to launch," the agency concluded in the
                    notice. "This way, the FAA is able to work with the reentry
                    operator to meet the required risk and other criteria."

                    The notice did not state what prompted the change. However,
                    it comes after Varda Space Industries launched its first
                    spacecraft in June 2023 but

                    other for SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft. However, the FAA
                    expects demand for those licenses to increase as more
                    companies seek to return cargo or crew from space.

                    Testing new ideas by simply shoving them at your customers
                    describes a mindset that is, well, nerdish. It's direct,
                    it's matter-of-factual and it can be somewhat grating.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An alternative is to communicate with your customers first
                    -- or, dare one mention it -- use a little charm and wit to
                    entice, rather than repel.

                    Instead of instantly shoving recommended apps on the Start
                    Menu, perhaps Microsoft could have teased one or two popular
                    app recommendations in, say, a humorous way. Humor can be
                    disarming in a way that arm-twisting is not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft could even have shown that it respected its
                    customers' mindset and declared: "Look, we know you don't
                    like ads much, but these apps might just be useful."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Similarly, in the case of the Copilot ads on Edge, Microsoft
                    could have used the voice of its new AI: "Hey, did you know
                    that Copilot can make your life just a tiny, tiny bit
                    easier? Want to see how?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Of course, there's a difference between inserting a
                    product change you feel sure the customers will like, as
                    opposed to one that you know -- you just know -- they'll see
                    as merely the company trying to make more money.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But when customers -- particularly paying customers --
                    are faced with the cold insertion of something they may
                    instinctively be resistant to, they tend to respond with
                    frigid irritation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Microsoft has understood that human warmth is a
                    valuable asset, one that isn't immediately revealed on its
                    balance sheet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you recognize the truth of that, you have to carry it
                    through all of your communication. Even the most basic,
                    potentially irritating communication.
                    <em>Especially</em> the most basic, potentially irritating

                    The 46-year-old Nasa spacecraft is humanity's most distant

                    A computer fault stopped it returning readable data in

                    For the moment, Voyager is sending back only health data
                    about its onboard systems, but further work should get the
                    scientific instruments back online.

                    "Voyager-1 spacecraft is returning usable data about the
                    health and status of its onboard engineering systems," Nasa
                    said in a statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The next step is to enable the spacecraft to begin
                    returning science data again."

                    [...] A corrupted chip has been blamed for the ageing
                    spacecraft's recent woes.

                  <p>
                    This prevented Voyager's computers from accessing a vital
                    segment of software code used to package information for
                    transmission to Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For a period of time, engineers could get no sense
                    whatsoever out of Voyager, even though they could tell the
                    spacecraft was still receiving their commands and otherwise
                    operating normally.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The issue was resolved by shifting the affected code to
                    different locations in the memory of the probe's computers.

                    [...] Part of the issue is that Framework relies on external
                    companies to put together firmware updates. Some components
                    are provided by Intel, AMD, and other chip companies to all
                    PC companies that use their chips. Others are provided by
                    Insyde, which writes UEFI firmware for Framework and others.
                    And some are handled by Compal, the contract manufacturer
                    that actually produces Framework's systems and has also
                    designed and sold systems for most of the big-name PC
                    companies.

                    firmware support for Framework laptops. However, the
                    benefits of this arrangement have been slow to reach users.

                    [...] Framework puts a lot of effort into making its
                    hardware easy to fix and upgrade and into making sure that
                    hardware can stay useful down the line when it's been
                    replaced by something newer. But supporting that kind of
                    reuse and recycling works best when paired with long-term
                    software and firmware support, and on that front, Framework
                    has been falling short.

                    Framework will need to step up its game, especially if it
                    wants to sell more laptops to businesses—a lucrative slice
                    of the PC industry that Framework is actively courting. By
                    this summer or fall, we'll have some idea of whether its
                    efforts are succeeding.

                    For most of its active service history, the U-2 flew with an
                    onboard camera capable of a 66-inch focal length. The
                    aircraft often flew as high as 70,000 feet and still took
                    excellent images of targets miles away. This was long before
                    the advent of digital imagery, so the U-2's unique optical
                    bar camera required the development of wet film.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The film had to be developed at Beale Air Force Base in
                    California by the 9th Reconnaissance Wing before analysts
                    could check it for intelligence data. Despite the difficulty
                    the camera posed, its worth was apparent in the intelligence
                    products it produced. Still, the USAF finally replaced the
                    antiquated technology in the summer of 2022.

                    and let the system operate the aircraft, so innovations
                    continue despite the aircraft's planned retirement. This
                    isn't the first time the U-2 has been on the chopping block,
                    so there's a chance it could survive its planned
                    obsolescence in FY26, but only time will tell.

                    CVE-2022-38028 since at least June 2020—and possibly as
                    early as April 2019. The threat group—which is also tracked
                    under names including APT28, Sednit, Sofacy, GRU Unit 26165,

                    Since as early as April 2019, Forest Blizzard has been
                    exploiting CVE-2022-38028 in attacks that, once system
                    privileges are acquired, use a previously undocumented tool
                    that Microsoft calls GooseEgg. The post-exploitation malware
                    elevates privileges within a compromised system and goes on
                    to provide a simple interface for installing additional
                    pieces of malware that also run with system privileges. This
                    additional malware, which includes credential stealers and
                    tools for moving laterally through a compromised network,
                    can be customized for each target.

                    that the fix for CVE-2022-38028 has been installed, as well
                    as the fix for CVE-2021-34527, the tracking designation for
                    a previous critical zero-day that came under mass attack in
                    2021.

                    Mazda also attempted to solve one of the biggest problems of
                    the Wankel rotary engine — the incomplete combustion of all
                    the fuel in the air-fuel mixture — by incorporating two
                    spark plugs to combust both compressed air-fuel volumes
                    created within a single cycle of the rotor. In its latest
                    rotary engine design used in the November 2023 Mazda MX-30
                    Skyactiv R-EV, the Japanese company also changed the
                    location of the fuel intake to the top of the housing,
                    separating it from the air intake, thereby keeping it in the
                    main intake area and increasing atomization to improve the
                    incomplete combustion of fuel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another Mazda rotary engine innovation is using an auxiliary
                    intake port valve that can swivel open to increase the
                    amount of air during the intake phase when required for more
                    power at higher RPMs. Later designs of the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.slashgear.com/1384727/mazda-iconic-rotary-engine-explained/"
                      >Mazda rotary engine</a
                    >
                    included two more valves for greater air intake when needed
                    at higher RPMs. So, to answer the question, do rotary
                    engines have valves? Yes, they do, including in some of the
                    most popular rotary engines of all time — those used in the
                    Mazda RX-7 and Mazda RX-8.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rotary engines have three power phases instead of just the
                    one of a four-stroke engine. This, along with the way the
                    rotor is mated to the gear of the output shaft, means that
                    for every complete rotation of the rotor, the output shaft
                    rotates thrice, instead of just once, as with a
                    reciprocating piston engine. All four phases occur within a
                    single cycle of the rotor, rather than one at a time in a
                    four-stroke piston engine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is also no need for a minimum of two valves (intake
                    and exhaust) per cylinder as seen in a piston engine.
                    Instead, fuel enters via intake ports that don't need to
                    open and close. In a Wankel rotary engine, air and fuel are
                    pulled in by a partial vacuum, and combusted gases are
                    pushed out by pressure. However, various valves have been
                    adopted to deliver variable valve timing for better air
                    intake at different RPMs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In its simplest form, a Wankel rotary engine has just two
                    moving parts: the rotor and the output shaft. Compare that
                    to modern piston cylinder engines, which have over 40 moving
                    parts. Of course, in many iterations of the rotary engine,
                    Mazda used two rotors rather than one, bringing the total
                    number of moving parts to three. You get at least three more
                    moving parts if you include the extra air intake valves the
                    company added in later years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Advantages of a rotary engine include its compact size,
                    which makes it lightweight and gives it a higher
                    power-to-weight ratio than piston engines. Its simple design
                    with fewer moving parts makes it easier to produce, and
                    the parts also move slower compared to piston engines,
                    making rotary engines more reliable in terms of wear and
                    tear. A reciprocating engine needs its power translated to
                    rotational motion, whereas the rotary engine produces direct
                    rotational motion, creating much lower vibration, higher
                    RPMs, and smoother power delivery. Rotary engines are also
                    touted for their multi-fuel capabilities, ranging from
                    gasoline to ethanol and natural gas.

                  <p>
                    Disadvantages of a rotary engine include lower fuel
                    efficiency, increased emissions (thanks to the use of oil —
                    that is combusted alongside the air-fuel mixture — within
                    the housing to better lubricate and seal the rotor), and
                    regular replacement of the seals (apex, face, and side).
                    Rotary engines also have reduced thermodynamic efficiency
                    thanks to the large rotor housing with combustion happening
                    only in certain sections, which leads to different
                    temperatures of the housing, causing uneven expansion and
                    difficulty in maintaining a seal. [...]

                    The physicists found that a tachyon cosmological model was
                    just as good at explaining the supernova data as the
                    standard cosmological model involving dark matter and dark
                    energy. That itself is a surprise, given how unorthodox this
                    idea is.

                  <p>
                    However, that's only the beginning. We now have access to a
                    wealth of data about the large-scale universe, like the
                    cosmic microwave background (remnant radiation released just
                    after the Big Bang) and the arrangement of galaxies at the
                    very largest scales. The next step is to continue testing
                    this idea against those additional observations.

                  <p>
                    The tachyon cosmological model is unlikely to pass those
                    rigorous experimental tests, given the unlikely nature of
                    tachyons. But continuing to push in new, even unorthodox,
                    directions is important in

                    any conclusive results. The solutions to these conundrums

                is a species of algae, a coastal coccolithophore in the fossil

                to have engulfed a cyanobacterium that lets them do something
                that algae, and plants in general, can't normally do: "fixing"
                nitrogen straight from the air, and combining it with other
                elements to create more useful compounds.

                    Nitrogen is a key nutrient, and normally plants and algae
                    get theirs through symbiotic relationships with bacteria
                    that remain separate. At first it was thought that B.
                    bigelowii had hooked up this kind of situation with a
                    bacterium called UCYN-A, but on closer inspection,
                    scientists discovered that the two have gotten far more
                    intimate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In one recent study, a team found that the size ratio
                    between the algae and UCYN-A stays similar across different
                    related species of the algae. Their growth appears to be
                    controlled by the exchange of nutrients, leading to linked
                    metabolisms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "That's exactly what happens with organelles," said Jonathan
                    Zehr, an author of the studies. "If you look at the
                    mitochondria and the chloroplast, it's the same thing: they
                    scale with the cell."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a follow-up study, the team and other collaborators used
                    a powerful X-ray imaging technique to view the interior of
                    the living algae cells. This revealed that the replication
                    and cell division was synchronized between the host and
                    symbiote – more

                  <p>
                    And finally, the team compared the proteins of isolated
                    UCYN-A to those inside the algal cells. They found that the
                    isolated bacterium can only produce about half of the
                    proteins it needs, relying on the algal host to provide the
                    rest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "That's one of the hallmarks of something moving from an
                    endosymbiont to an organelle," said Zehr. "They start
                    throwing away pieces of DNA, and their genomes get smaller
                    and smaller, and they start depending on the mother cell for
                    those gene products – or the protein itself – to be
                    transported into the cell."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Altogether, the team says this indicates UCYN-A is a full
                    organelle, which is given the name of nitroplast. It appears
                    that this began to evolve around 100 million years ago,
                    which sounds like an incredibly long time but is a blink of
                    an eye compared to mitochondria and chloroplasts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers plan to continue studying nitroplasts, to
                    find out if they're present in other cells and what effects
                    they may have. One possible benefit is that it could give
                    scientists a new avenue to incorporate nitrogen-fixing into
                    plants to grow better crops.

                -----<br />Hopefully this behavior has been going on for tens of
                millions of years, if this is a newer development it could
                become a significant evolutionary advantage - radically changing

                The culprit of service is the second generation of the EU's
                Cybersecurity Directive (NIS2). The new legislation widely
                extends its
                <a
                  href="https://ccb.belgium.be/sites/default/files/NIS-2%20Scope%20visual.pdf"
                  >scope</a
                >
                to nearly any company with more than 50 employees and €10M+ in
                yearly revenue. On top of that, the number of industrial sectors
                which are deemed essential in terms of critical infrastructure
                doubles from 6 to 12, including ICT service management,
                government institutions, post and courier services,
                manufacturing companies, the food-processing industry, waste
                water management, space companies, research organisations and
                the chemical industry as a whole. Suppliers to these companies
                can also fall under the new regulation.
              </p>
              <p>
                In practice, national centers for cybersecurity will be
                responsible to execute cybersecurity checks through audits
                and/or unannounced security scans. If the target company
                neglects their recommendations, it risks heavy fines: at least 2
                percent of worldwide revenue up to a maximum of €10 million for
                companies with more than 250 employees, or more than €50 million
                yearly revenue. Smaller companies risk at least 1.4 percent of
                yearly revenue with a maximum of €7 million.
              </p>
              <p>
                These fines cannot just be classified under company expenses,
                though. Under the new regulation, CEOs and board members are
                obligated to follow cybersecurity training, and to sign off on
                all cybersecurity measures. They are deemed personally
                responsible, and run the risk of being barred temporarily from
                similar roles, and -- most importantly -- of having to pay the
                resulting fine out of their own pocket, not through the company.

                    Production of some models of Z80 processor – the chip that
                    helped spark the PC boom of the 1980s – will cease in June
                    2024 after an all-too-brief 48 years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Z80 debuted in 1976, using a 4-micron process. Readers
                    will doubtless be aware that some modern silicon is made on
                    a 4-nanometer process – meaning elements are 1,000 times
                    smaller than those etched into a Z80.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Zilog will accept orders for the device until June 14, 2024.
                    After that, it's the end for the eight-bit CPU – or at least
                    the ZC8400 range. Zilog appears to still make the Z180 and
                    eZ80 – successors that added lots of whistles and bells and
                    are often packaged into SoCs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The original Z80 packed just 8,500 transistors and chugged
                    along at 2.5Mhz, but that was enough to power lots of fun
                    stuff – helped by the fact that it was compatible with
                    Intel's 8080 processor and sold at a cheaper price.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Sinclair ZX range was perhaps the most famous
                    application of the Z80, using it to power affordable and
                    accessible machines that
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/09/19/remembering_clive_sinclair/"

                    >
                    (and writers) to tech. The chip also found its way into
                    arcade games such as Pac Man, and early Roland synthesizers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Zilog was overtaken by Intel in the PC market, and by
                    the 1990s decided to focus on microcontrollers instead. The
                    Z80 was one of its key offerings, and over the years was
                    adapted and enhanced: we even spotted a new variant of the
                    chip in
                    <a

                  <p>
                    That sort of upgrade helped the processor and its heirs to
                    hold on in some consumer-facing applications such as
                    graphing calculators like the TI-84 Plus CE. But it mostly
                    disappeared into industrial kit, where it hummed along
                    reliably and offered developers a tried-and-true target for
                    their code.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Perhaps someone will place a giant order for ZC8400s to
                    hoard them, so that those committed to the platform can
                    continue to get kit – a plausible scenario given the
                    likelihood the processor retains a hidden-but-critical role
                    in defense or some legacy tech that will persist for
                    decades.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Or perhaps there's one last batch of ZX Spectrums to be
                    made!

                    In what has been hailed as a milestone moment for artificial
                    intelligence's use in the military, the US Air Force has
                    announced that it successfully tested a modified,
                    AI-controlled fighter jet in a dogfight against human pilots
                    last year.

                    The US Air Force Test Pilot School and the Defense Advanced
                    Research Projects Agency (DARPA) first started testing a
                    Lockheed Martin X-62A VISTA (Variable In-flight Simulation
                    Test Aircraft) fitted with AI software back in

                    on Thursday that in September 2023, the X-62A carried out
                    the first successful AI versus human within-visual-range
                    engagements, also known as a dogfight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The AI dogfights paired the X-62A VISTA against manned F-16
                    aircraft in the skies above Edwards Air Force Base in Kern
                    County, California. After initial flight safety was built up
                    using defensive maneuvers, the aircraft switched to
                    offensive high-aspect nose-to-nose engagements where they
                    approached within 2,000 feet of each other at 1,200 miles
                    per hour. It isn't revealed which side won the simulated
                    battle.

                    [...] In addition to its autonomous flight capabilities, the
                    X-62A VISTA, a modified F-16, also features a
                    high-resolution camera, a compact size, lightweight
                    construction, and is versatile enough to be used for a wide
                    range of applications, including scientific research,
                    surveillance, recon, environmental monitoring, and emergency
                    response.

                    Could Air Force pilots be yet another profession that is
                    eventually threatened by AI? The 2020
                    <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2020-08-26"
                      >AlphaDogfight Trials</a
                    >, a three-day competition designed to demonstrate advanced
                    algorithms capable of dogfighting (using VR simulations),
                    saw an experienced F-16 Air Force pilot lose 5-0 to the AI
                    agent. DARPA said the machine performed aggressive and
                    precise maneuvers that the human pilot could not match.

                  <p>
                    DARPA says that the X-62A VISTA will continue to serve a
                    variety of customers for research while providing key
                    academic lessons for the next generation of test leaders.

                        It wasn't clear what tool it was, but let's make sure it
                        gets fixed. Because if you can't parse tabs as
                        whitespace, you should not be parsing the kernel Kconfig
                        files.

                        In fact, let's make such breakage more obvious than some
                        esoteric ftrace record size option. If you can't parse
                        tabs, you can't have page sizes.

                      <p>
                        Yes, tab-vs-space confusion is sadly a traditional Unix
                        thing, and 'make' is famous for being broken in this
                        regard. But no, that does not mean that it's ok.

                    World-renowned philosopher Daniel Dennett, who championed
                    controversial takes on consciousness and free will among
                    other mind-bending subjects, died today at the age of 82.

                    the natural world," Johns Hopkins University physicist and
                    philosopher Sean Carroll told Ars. "At the same time, he was
                    the model of a publicly engaged academic, someone who wrote
                    substantive books that anyone could read and who had a real
                    impact on the wider world. People like that are incredibly

                    and free will. "Our only notable divergence was on the
                    question of free will, which Dan maintained exists, in some
                    sense of 'free,' whereas I just agreed that 'will' exists,
                    but maintained that there is no freedom in it," Hoftstadter

                I initially came across Dennett's writings in his book
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mind's_I"
                  >The Mind's I</a
                >
                which he wrote with Douglas Hofstader including texts from other
                authors. It was when I first started to dip my toes into the
                philosopy of mind. He brings up some fascinating ideas from a
                rational perspective which always provoke a lot of thought and
                discussion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to my being in the same philosophical camp as Dennett's
                great rival David Chalmers, I tend to side with those who called
                Denett's book,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness_explained"
                  >Consciousness Explained</a
                >, Consciousness Avoided (Dennett actually wrote an epilogue in
                response to this accusation). This is because, as I understand
                it, Dennett has always strived to explain consciousness using
                only axioms derived directly from accepted science, which means
                it all starts and ends with a third person perspective. Dennett
                always raised some interesting counterarguments to other
                philosophers that attempted to discuss the really interesting
                first person phenomena of consciousness, so whether you agree
                with him or not, he represented a key school of thought in
                modern philosophy.

                    report this week. While Prime Video users aren't the only
                    streaming users dealing with these problems, Insider's
                    examination of leaked "internal documents" brings more
                    perspective into the impact of mislabeling and similar
                    errors on streaming platforms.

                    Insider didn't publish the documents but said they show that
                    "60 percent of all content-related customer-experience
                    complaints for Prime Video last year were about catalogue

                    missing titles.<br />[...]<br />Following Insider's report,

                    reported that an unnamed source it described as "familiar
                    with the matter" said the documents were out of date,
                    despite Insider claiming that the leaked reports included
                    data from 2023. Quartz's source also claimed that customer
                    engagement was not affected,

                    Ars Technica reached out to Amazon for comment but didn't
                    hear back in time for publication. The company told Insider
                    that "catalogue quality is an ongoing priority" and that
                    Amazon takes "it seriously and work[s] relentlessly

                    Eric S Raymond has released version 0.2 of Autodafe, his
                    latest open-source project that provides "tools for freeing
                    your project from the clammy grip of Autotools."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Autodafe works to convert an Autotools build recipe into a
                    bare makefile that "can be read and modified by humans." The
                    Autodafe's README explains:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                            "This project collects resources for converting an
                    autotools build recipe to a bare makefile that can be read
                    and modified by humans.<br />
                            ...<br />
                            The principal tool, makemake, reduces a generated
                    Makefile to an equivalent form suitable for human
                    modification and with internal automake cruft removed. It is
                    intended to be used with ifdex(1) to enable severing a
                    project from its autotools build recipe, leaving a bare
                    Makefile in place. A HOWTO describing a conversion workflow
                    for an entire project is included.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                            One other tool is planned but not yet implemented."

                    Those wishing to learn more about ESR's Autodafe project can
                    do so via GitLab.<br /><a

                  <p>
                            "Release 0.2 of my autotools killer. It's ready for
                    use on projects buiilding binaries or static libraries.
                    Shared libraries is a more difficult problem and will gate
                    the 1.0 release."

                  <p>
                    This is one way to work away from Autotools for those not
                    wishing to join the Meson bandwagon or going to another
                    build system outright.

                This project intrigues me. It brings sanity to GNU. I consider
                Unix M4 (core macro language of Autotools) inferior even as a
                macro language.<br />I am used to craft a Makefile for my
                projects by hand, for decades. Having a humanized Makefile for
                fancy projects of others seems nice to me.

                efficient energy conversion – more efficient than electron
                transportation which is used in the power network."

              <p>
                "At present we can harvest around 1 per cent of the total energy
                carried intrinsically by gas CO2 but like other technologies, we
                will now work on improving efficiency and reducing cost."

                "We could make a slightly bigger device that is portable to
                generate electricity to power a mobile phone or a laptop
                computer using CO2 from the atmosphere," Professor Zhang said.

              <p>
                "A second application on a much larger scale, would integrate
                this technology with an industrial CO2 capture process to
                harvest electricity."

                    Colorado Governor Jared Polis on Wednesday signed into law
                    the first measure passed in the U.S. that aims to protect
                    the data found in a person's brainwaves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sponsors of the bill said it was necessary as quick advances
                    in neurotechnology make scanning, analyzing and selling
                    mental data increasingly more possible - and profitable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    State representative Cathy Kipp, a sponsor of the
                    legislation, said in a statement that while advancements in
                    the neurotechnology field hold great promise for improving
                    the lives of many people, "we must provide a clear framework
                    to protect Coloradans' personal data from being used without
                    their consent while still allowing these new technologies to
                    develop."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    State senator Kevin Priola, another of the bill's sponsors,
                    said that neurotechnology "is no longer confined to medical
                    or research settings" and that when it comes to consumer
                    products, the industry "can currently operate without
                    regulation, data protection standards, or equivalent ethical
                    constraints."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Colorado law notes that neuratechnologies used in a
                    clinical setting are already covered by medical privacy
                    laws, so the new measure is aimed at consumer products
                    available outside of a hospital.

                    Microsoft has lifted a 29-month compatibility hold that
                    prevented some Windows 10 systems from upgrading to Windows

                    back then [Nov 2021] that certain versions of drivers for
                    Intel Smart Sound Technology (SST) could trip up the newest
                    version of its Windows operating system – Windows 11 – and
                    so threw up a compatibility hold to stop users updating from
                    Windows 10 and encountering blue screen unpleasantness.

                  <p>
                    According to Microsoft: "Only devices with both an Intel
                    11th Gen Core processors and an Intel SST driver version of
                    10.29.0.5152 or 10.30.0.5152 are affected by this issue."

                    [...] It is debatable how many users are still affected by
                    the issue. We asked Microsoft and will update should the

                        molars and premolars can look similar, the specific

                    cut. And one is far more likely to find fossils of algae,
                    plants, mollusks, crustaceans, or similar smaller creatures
                    than human remains. "Believe me, anthropologists don't want
                    to hear about every blob of bone in your tile," Hawks wrote.
                    "But certainly somebody has more pieces of the mandible of
                    the Reddit post."

                    [...] The research team focused on two particular elements:
                    sulfur and chlorine. Sulfur has two common non-radioactive
                    isotopes, 32S and 34S, and chlorine, its neighbor on the
                    periodic table, has 35Cl and 37Cl. There are differences in
                    the ratio of these isotopes throughout the bodies of the
                    Solar System, but those differences are generally small.
                    And, because we think we know what sort of material
                    contributed to the formation of Io, we can focus on the
                    ratios found in bodies that have a similar origin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chlorine enters the atmosphere from volcanoes primarily in
                    the form of sodium and potassium salts. These have a very
                    short half-life before they're split up by exposure to light
                    and radiation. The ALMA data indicated both these chemicals
                    were present in localized regions, likely corresponding to
                    active volcanic plumes. The data from the chlorine isotopes
                    were a bit noisy, so were largely used as a sanity check for
                    the ones obtained from sulfur isotopes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The intriguing thing about this—or at least one of
                    them—is that it implies that Io has some system that's
                    cycling the sulfur dioxide that erupts to the surface back
                    into the interior of the moon where it can take part in
                    volcanism again. There's no indication of any plate
                    tectonics on the moon, so we don't have a clear analog for
                    what can be driving the process on Io.

                    autonomous property monitoring devices that will utilize
                    motion detection and facial recognition to guard against
                    supposed intruders. In the company's

                    >, a voiceover promises Eve will protect owners from
                    burglars, unwanted animal guests, and any hapless passersby
                    who fail to heed its "zero compliance, zero tolerance"
                    warning.<br />[...]<br />"Experience ultimate peace of

                    <a href="https://paintcam.eu/">PaintCam's website</a>
                    declares, as Eve will offer owners a "perfect fusion of
                    video security and physical presence" thanks to its
                    "unintrusive [sic] design that stands as a beacon of
                    safety."<br />[...]<br />There are apparently "Standard,"
                    "Advanced," and "Elite" versions of PaintCam Eve in the
                    works. The basic tier only gets owners "smart security" and
                    "app on/off" capabilities, while Eve+ also offers animal
                    detection. Eve Pro apparently is the only one to include
                    facial recognition, which implies the other two models could
                    be a tad more... indiscriminate in their surveillance
                    methodologies. It's unclear how much extra you'll need to
                    shell out for the teargas tier, too.

                    According to the Reuters Institute for the Study of
                    Journalism, more than 75 percent of America's leading
                    newspapers, magazines, and journals are behind online
                    paywalls. And how do American news consumers react to that?
                    Almost 80 percent of Americans steer around those paywalls
                    and seek out a free option.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Paywalls create a two-tiered system: credible, fact-based
                    information for people who are willing to pay for it, and
                    murkier, less-reliable information for everyone else. Simply
                    put, paywalls get in the way of informing the public, which
                    is the mission of journalism. And they get in the way of the
                    public being informed, which is the foundation of democracy.
                    It is a terrible time for the press to be failing at
                    reaching people, during an election in which democracy is on
                    the line. There's a simple, temporary solution: Publications
                    should suspend their paywalls for all 2024 election coverage
                    and all information that is beneficial to voters. Democracy
                    does not die in darkness—it dies behind paywalls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem is not just that professionally produced news is
                    behind a wall; the problem is that paywalls increase the
                    proportion of free and easily available stories that are
                    actually filled with misinformation and disinformation. Way
                    back in 1995 (think America Online), the UCLA professor
                    Eugene Volokh predicted that the rise of "cheap speech"—free
                    internet content—would not only democratize mass media by
                    allowing new voices, but also increase the proliferation of
                    misinformation and conspiracy theories, which would then
                    destabilize mass media.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Digital-news consumers can be divided into three
                    categories: a small, elite group that pays hundreds to
                    thousands of dollars a year for high-end subscriptions; a
                    slightly larger group of people with one to three news
                    subscriptions; and the roughly 80 percent of Americans who
                    will not or cannot pay for information. Some significant
                    percentage of this latter category are what scholars call
                    "passive" news consumers—people who do not seek out
                    information, but wait for it to come to them, whether from
                    their social feeds, from friends, or from a TV in an
                    airport. Putting reliable information behind paywalls
                    increases the likelihood that passive news consumers will
                    receive bad information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Part of the problem with the current, free news
                    environment is that the platform companies, which are the
                    largest distributors of free news, have deprioritized news.
                    [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As the platforms have diminished news, they have also
                    weakened their integrity and content-moderation teams, which
                    enforce community standards or terms of service. No major
                    platform permits false advertising, child pornography, hate
                    speech, or speech that leads to violence; the integrity and
                    moderation teams take down such content. A recent paper from
                    Barrett's team at the NYU Stern Center for Business and
                    Human Rights argues that the greatest tech-related threat in
                    2024 is not artificial intelligence or foreign election
                    interference, but something more mundane: the retreat from
                    content moderation and the hollowing-out of trust-and-safety
                    units and election-integrity teams. The increase in bad
                    information on the free web puts an even greater burden on
                    fact-based news reporting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now AI-created clickbait is also a growing threat.
                    Generative AI's ability to model, scrape, and even
                    plagiarize real news—and then tailor it to users—is
                    extraordinary. AI clickbait mills, posing as legitimate
                    journalistic organizations, are churning out content that
                    rips off real news and reporting. These plagiarism mills are
                    receiving funding because, well, they're cheap and
                    profitable. For now, Google's rankings don't appear to make
                    a distinction between a news article written by a human
                    being and one written by an AI chatbot. They can, and they
                    should.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The best way to address these challenges is for newsrooms to
                    remove or suspend their paywalls for stories related to the
                    2024 election. I am mindful of the irony of putting this
                    plea behind The Atlantic's own paywall, but that's exactly
                    where the argument should be made. If you're reading this,
                    you've probably paid to support journalism that you think
                    matters in the world. Don't you want it to be available to
                    others, too, especially those who would not otherwise get to
                    see it?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Good journalism isn't cheap, but outlets can find
                    creative ways to pay for their reporting on the election.
                    They can enlist foundations or other sponsors to underwrite
                    their work. They can turn to readers who are willing to
                    subscribe, renew their subscriptions, or make added
                    donations to subsidize important coverage during a crucial
                    election. And they can take advantage of the broader
                    audience that unpaywalled stories can reach, using it to
                    generate more advertising revenue—and even more civic-minded
                    subscribers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] I believe it was a mistake to give away journalism for
                    free in the 1990s. Information is not and never has been
                    free. I devoutly believe that news organizations need to
                    survive and figure out a revenue model that allows them to
                    do so. But the most important mission of a news organization
                    is to provide the public with information that allows
                    citizens to make the best decisions in a constitutional
                    democracy. Our government derives its legitimacy from the
                    consent of the governed, and that consent is arrived at
                    through the free flow of information—reliable, fact-based
                    information. To that end, news organizations should put
                    their election content in front of their paywall. The
                    Constitution protects the press so that the press can
                    protect constitutional democracy. Now the press must fulfill
                    its end of the bargain.

                    The study also found that different bird species have
                    different impacts in terms of seed dispersal. Smaller birds
                    disperse more seeds, but they can only spread small seeds
                    from trees with lower carbon storage potential. In contrast,
                    larger birds such as the Toco toucan or the Curl-crested jay
                    disperse the seeds of trees with a higher carbon storage
                    potential. The problem is that the larger birds are less
                    likely to move across highly fragmented landscapes.

                    "This crucial information enables us to pinpoint active
                    restoration efforts—like tree planting—in landscapes falling
                    below this forest cover threshold, where assisted
                    restoration is most urgent and effective," Daisy Dent, a
                    Lead Scientist in the Crowther Lab at ETH Zurich.

                    "Allowing larger frugivores to move freely across forest
                    landscapes is critical for healthy tropical forest
                    recovery," says Carolina Bello, a post-doctoral researcher
                    also in the Crowther Lab at ETH Zurich and lead author of
                    the study. "This study demonstrates that especially in
                    tropical ecosystems seed dispersal mediated by birds, plays
                    a fundamental role in determining the species that can
                    regenerate."

                    [...] "By identifying the thresholds of forest cover in the
                    surrounding landscape that allow seed dispersal, we can
                    identify areas where natural regeneration is possible, as
                    well as areas where we need to actively plant trees,
                    allowing us to maximize the cost-effectiveness of forest
                    restoration," says Danielle Ramos, a co-author of the paper

                    GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket “have evolved dramatically to

                    GitLab is taking a similar approach with AI-powered
                    assistants and is working hard to differentiate itself from
                    GitHub, he says.

                  <p>
                    But the emergence of genAI and how LLMs are trained is a
                    particular concern for some organizations, Condo says. “It’s
                    public information that tools like GitHub Copilot use source
                    code from public [version control] systems they host to
                    train their model,” he says. “Buyers need to decide if they
                    are comfortable with that or if they would prefer their code
                    not be used for that purpose.”

                  <p>
                    Organizations with sensitive algorithms or concerns that
                    intellectual property (IP) will be leaked need to look for
                    safeguards to protect their IP from being used as training
                    data, Condo says. “If the goal is to share the IP as an
                    open-sourced project, it might be perfectly fine, as long as
                    the customer can decide,” he says.
