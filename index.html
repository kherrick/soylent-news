                    Thirty years ago, a breakthrough technology was poised to
                    transform how people stayed informed, entertained
                    themselves, and maybe even shopped. I'm not talking about
                    the World Wide Web. True, it was already getting good buzz
                    among early adopter types. But even three years after going
                    online, Tim Berners-Lee's creation was "still relatively
                    slow and crude" and "limited to perhaps two million Internet
                    users who have the proper software to gain access to it,"
                    wrote The New York Times' Peter H. Lewis in November 1994.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the time, it was the CD-ROM that had captured the
                    imagination of consumers and the entire publishing industry.
                    The high-capacity optical discs enabled mass distribution of
                    multimedia for the first time, giving software developers
                    the ability to create new kinds of experiences. Some of the
                    largest companies in America saw them as media's next
                    frontier, as did throngs of startups. In terms of pure
                    mindshare, 1994 might have been the year of Peak CD, with
                    17.5 million CD-ROM drives and $590 million in discs sold,
                    according to research firms Dataquest and Link Resources.

                    Another graduate student from Saha's team, Autumn
                    McLane-Svoboda and an undergrad, Summer McLane-Svoboda
                    jointly led the human lung cancer cell culture experiments
                    with the help of Christopher Contag, director of Michigan
                    State University's Institute for Quantitative Health Science
                    and Engineering, and his lab. For these experiments,
                    different types of human lung cancer cell cultures were
                    grown in closed, airtight flasks and the honeybee
                    brain-based sensor was used to test the odor of the lung
                    cancer cells. The researchers have successfully demonstrated
                    that using this honeybee brain-based sensor can distinguish
                    between small cell lung cancer, non-small lung cancer cells
                    and healthy cells.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "What's amazing is the honeybees ability to not only detect
                    cancer cells, but also distinguish between cell lines of
                    various types of lung cancer," said Autumn McLane-Svoboda.
                    "The future implications for this are huge as our sensor
                    could allow for patients to receive specific cancer
                    diagnoses quickly which is imperative for correct treatment
                    routes."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Saha envisions this work will open the door for more
                    biological and smell-based disease detection technologies.
                    In the future, Saha's team plans to develop a noninvasive
                    test that only requires patients breathe into a device and
                    the sensor inside, based on honeybee brains, would analyze
                    the breath and wirelessly report back in real time if cancer
                    chemicals are present.

                    [...] Below-ground microbial activity not only builds soil
                    fertility, which enables farmers to use less fertilizer, but
                    also helps reduce erosion, conserve water, and sequester
                    carbon. But field practices that are good for soil microbes
                    are not always good for relations with neighbors and
                    landlords.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Farmers mentioned that when they stopped tilling and
                    started planting multi-species cover crops, they started
                    getting strange looks at their local coffee shop because now
                    their fields looked messy," said Freidberg.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These tensions made regenerative farmers' relationships with
                    each other all the more important with some indicating that
                    they joined informal "support groups" to share experiences
                    or farm equipment. "Farmers who viewed regenerative
                    agriculture as a way to gain more personal freedom also saw
                    that this freedom depended on the support of other farmers,"
                    said Freidberg.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some farmers also mentioned how they liked seeing birds and
                    other wildlife returning to their fields, and how farming
                    regeneratively had made their day-to-day work more enjoyable
                    and interesting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The handful of farmers in the study who had signed up for
                    carbon programs emphasized that they looked for programs
                    that did not demand long-term commitments or major changes
                    in their farming practices. One farmer described it as a way
                    to earn "beer money."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But whether many farmers enroll in them, said
                    Freidberg, will depend at least partly on how well the
                    projects take account of what farmers value about such
                    practices. "When farmers talk about the return on investment
                    on regenerative agriculture, they're talking about more than
                    just money," said Freidberg.

                    Japan’s parliament passed a landmark law on Wednesday,
                    officially titled the Act on Promotion of Competition for
                    Specified Smartphone Software. The law is a direct response
                    to concerns about stifled competition and consumer choice,
                    particularly regarding Apple’s

                  <p>
                    This legislation, echoing some elements of Europe’s recent
                    Digital Markets Act (DMA), aims to prevent tech giants like
                    Apple and Google from monopolizing app sales and operations
                    on their respective platforms, a practice generally known as
                    “gatekeeping.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Should these companies violate the new regulations,
                    they will face hefty fines — 20 percent of the offending
                    service’s domestic revenue, which can increase to 30 percent
                    if the anti-competitive behavior continues. These fines
                    represent a substantial increase from the existing
                    anti-monopoly penalties in Japan, which are set at 6 percent
                    of revenue gained through unfair practices.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                      >new regulations</a
                    >, the law specifies that companies identified under the law
                    as ‘designated providers’ cannot prevent third-party
                    providers from offering their own app stores, using
                    third-party billing systems, or providing items through
                    websites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, they cannot unfairly discriminate against app
                    developers or restrict the use of third-party browsers. Much
                    like Europe, Japan wants users to be able to change default
                    settings easily and have a choice among similar services for
                    browsers and search services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Scheduled to take effect by the end of 2025, this
                    legislation mirrors regulatory efforts seen in other parts
                    of the world. The European Union’s Digital Markets Act,
                    which was fully implemented in March, and recent legal
                    actions by the U.S. Department of Justice against large tech
                    firms illustrate a global push towards stricter control over
                    digital markets.

                    [...] On the one hand, the woman's injuries led the research
                    team to believe that she participated and died in battle, as
                    there was no sign of bone regrowth in her injuries. "She may
                    have died in a manner very similar to that of male knights,
                    and it is likely that she was wearing some kind of armor or
                    chain mail," says Rissech.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the other hand, she did not have the same dietary
                    indicators as some of the individuals analyzed: "We observed
                    a lower level of protein consumption in the case of this
                    woman, which could indicate lower status in the social
                    group," he says. Some researchers have hypothesized that she
                    was a servant who would have been called upon to join the
                    knights in defending the castle if the need arose, but the
                    URV researcher does not think so: "Her work as a servant
                    would have left signs on her bones, indicators of certain
                    types of physical activity that we could now identify".

                    those of the other warrior monks, whose job required them to
                    train in the use of the sword, an activity that leaves
                    verifiable marks which were also observed on the woman's
                    bones. "I believe that these remains belong to a female
                    warrior, but further analysis is needed to determine to what
                    extent this woman is contemporary with the other knights",
                    says Rissech. According to the researcher, we should picture
                    her as a warrior of about forty years of age, just under
                    five feet tall, neither stocky nor slender, and skillful
                    with a sword.

              <p>A snippet from a Wired article:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    "When Microsoft revealed in January that foreign government
                    hackers had once again breached its systems, the news
                    prompted another round of recriminations about the security
                    posture of the world's largest tech company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite the angst among policymakers, security experts, and
                    competitors, Microsoft faced no consequences for its latest
                    embarrassing failure. The United States government kept
                    buying and using Microsoft products, and senior officials
                    refused to publicly rebuke the tech giant. It was another
                    reminder of how insulated Microsoft has become from
                    virtually any government accountability, even as the Biden
                    administration vows to make powerful tech firms take more
                    responsibility for America's cyberdefense.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That state of affairs is unlikely to change even in the wake
                    of a new report by the Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB), a
                    group of government and industry experts, which lambasts
                    Microsoft for failing to prevent one of the worst hacking
                    incidents in the company's recent history. The report says
                    Microsoft's "security culture was inadequate and requires an
                    overhaul.""

                News consumption is down. The reasons appear to be multiple from
                that the readers don't trust the sources anymore,
                disinformation, journalistic agendas, AI (fake-) news or that
                news in general are just downers and sad to read.

                    This year's report reveals new findings about the
                    consumption of online news globally. It is based on a YouGov
                    survey of more than 95,000 people in 47 countries
                    representing half of the world's population.

                  <p>
                    The report looks at the growing importance of platforms in
                    news consumption and production, including more visual and
                    video-led social media such as TikTok, Instagram and
                    YouTube. It explores audience attitudes towards the use of
                    AI in news, the role of creators and news influencers, how
                    much people pay for news and more.

                    big tech companies, including social media, search engines,
                    and video platforms.

                    In this study, the researchers compiled and analyzed seismic
                    data recorded around the South Sandwich Islands from 121
                    repeating earthquakes that occurred between 1991 and 2023.
                    They have also utilized data from twin Soviet nuclear tests
                    between 1971 and 1974, as well as repeated French and
                    American nuclear tests from other studies of the inner core.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Vidale said the inner core's slowing speed was caused by the
                    churning of the liquid iron outer core that surrounds it,
                    which generates Earth's magnetic field, as well as
                    gravitational tugs from the dense regions of the overlying
                    rocky mantle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The implications of this change in the inner core's movement
                    for Earth's surface can only be speculated. Vidale said the
                    backtracking of the inner core may alter the length of a day
                    by fractions of a second: "It's very hard to notice, on the
                    order of a thousandth of a second, almost lost in the noise
                    of the churning oceans and atmosphere."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The USC scientists' future research aspires to chart the
                    trajectory of the inner core in even greater detail to
                    reveal exactly why it is shifting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The dance of the inner core might be even more lively than
                    we know so far," Vidale said.

                  <p>The initial updated TOS from Adobe stated:</p>
                  <blockquote>

                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The policy change was met with strong reactions from both
                    the consumers of Adobe's products and their employees, who
                    believe that the organization effectively wants to take
                    autonomy away from the customers and effectively steal their
                    content. To be fair to the users, the murky language used by
                    the tech giant does indicate that they are likely to use
                    consumers' data to train Firefly, their generative AI model.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another talking point was that the clients using Adobe
                    software to create projects under NDAs (non-disclosure
                    agreements) would have no choice but to find an alternative,
                    due to the lack of data privacy. As users of the software
                    company's products let their discontent known on social
                    media, Adobe came up with a blog post to clarify their stand
                    on the matter. As things stand, Adobe has confirmed that
                    they don't train Firefly with users' content, but that's of
                    little comfort when it's not written into the terms of
                    service.

                    Meta will start training its AI models using everyone's
                    social media posts though European Union users can opt out,
                    a luxury the rest of the world won't enjoy.

                    The move, which the Facebook parent detailed in an
                    announcement today, is ostensibly to bring its
                    machine-learning systems to Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meta has so far not included its European userbase in its AI
                    training data, presumably to avoid legal conflict with the
                    continent's privacy regulations. Now it's pushing ahead with
                    that despite complaints.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "To properly serve our European communities, the models that
                    power AI at Meta need to be trained on relevant information
                    that reflects the diverse languages, geography and cultural
                    references of the people in Europe who will use them," the
                    social media titan said.<br />...<br />Meta also says it has
                    sent billions of notifications to European users since May
                    22 to give them a chance to decline before the AI training
                    rules kick in worldwide on June 26. The Instagram goliath
                    says any user can decline, no questions asked, and that
                    their posts won't be used to train AI models now or ever.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is substantially different from the rest of the world,
                    where opting out just isn't a choice. Granted, it's already
                    too late to opt out for training data used for Meta's LLaMa
                    3, but even training for future models is mandatory for
                    Facebook and Instagram users outside of the EU. Perhaps
                    users outside of Europe will be able to choose to opt out in
                    the future, but for now it's a feature exclusive to the EU.

                    Cara, an Instagram-like app that has banned AI images from
                    its platform has exploded in popularity going from 40,000

                    Photographer Jingna Zhang founded Cara at the start of 2023
                    to be a safe space for creatives to share and publish their
                    art, find work, and avoid generative AI scraping. Its
                    creation stemmed from the rise of AI-generated art and lack
                    of protection offered by many social media platforms, which
                    have, in some cases, quietly used its user content without
                    permission or compensation to train AI models.

                    there has been a backlash against Instagram with Cara being

                    generator Midjourney.

                    Photoshop maker Adobe recently changed its terms of service

                    existing projects for so-called "content moderation"

                    The new policy notes that they "may access your content
                    through both automated and manual methods, such as for
                    content review."

                    They are justifying this blatant invasion of privacy by
                    claiming their intention is to detect and remove illegal

                    behavior like spam and phishing.

                  <p>
                    Right now, users are unable to use Photoshop until they have
                    agreed to the new terms of service. Moreover, those who want
                    to cancel their subscription because they don't agree to the
                    terms and conditions are finding that they must actually

                    [...] However, one of the biggest concerns is that Adobe can
                    now access work that is generated by people using their
                    platforms, such as Acrobat and Photoshop, and they can do
                    this not only by claiming they're looking for illegal
                    content but also to train AI platforms. They say that their
                    automated systems could analyze users' content with machine
                    learning with a view to improving their software, services
                    and user experience.

                    A study from the University of California San Diego reveals
                    that differences in brain development associated with autism
                    begin in utero, with larger and faster-growing brain
                    cortical organoids in autistic toddlers correlating with
                    more severe symptoms. This research opens new avenues for
                    understanding and potentially treating autism.

                    Some children with autism face severe, enduring challenges
                    including developmental delays, social difficulties, and
                    possibly an inability to speak. Meanwhile, others may have
                    milder symptoms that lessen over time.

                    The disparity in outcomes has been a mystery to scientists,
                    until now. A new study, published in
                    <em>Molecular Autism</em> by researchers at the University
                    of California San Diego, is the first to shed light on the
                    matter. Among its findings: The biological basis for these
                    two subtypes of autism develops in utero.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers used blood-based stem cells from 10 toddlers,
                    ages 1 through 4, with idiopathic autism (in which no
                    single-gene cause was identified) to create brain cortical
                    organoids (BCOs), or models of the fetal cortex. They also
                    created BCOs from six neurotypical toddlers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Often referred to as gray matter, the cortex lines the
                    outside of the brain. It holds tens of billions of nerve
                    cells and is responsible for essential functions like

                    significantly larger — roughly 40 percent — than those of
                    neurotypical controls, according to two rounds of study
                    performed in different years (2021 and 2022). Each round
                    involved the creation of hundreds of organoids from each

                    2024 targets will enable Copilot experiences later in 2024.
                    <em>Tom’s Hardware</em> clarified with AMD that this means
                    the features won't be available at launch. <br />
                      <br />
                      “Yes, Copilot+ will come via a Windows Update later this
                    year,”  we were told. This means that laptops with the Ryzen
                    AI processor won’t be Copilot+ certified at launch, so it
                    cannot use features

                    However, since AMD’s Ryzen AI 300 chips do not have
                    Microsoft’s AI certification yet, users who pick this
                    processor won’t enjoy those Copilot+ features, even though
                    the Ryzen AI 300’s NPU offers 50 TOPS — which ismore than
                    the 45 TOPS that the Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus outputs
                    via their NPUs. Nevertheless, AMD says that the Copilot+
                    certification will arrive later this year, meaning these
                    laptops will eventually get Windows’ AI features via a free
                    Windows Update.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But even if the Ryzen AI 300 chip does not get the Microsoft
                    Copilot+ branding at launch, you can still take advantage of
                    the processor’s AI capabilities via third-party software.
                    Apps like Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and Blender, which are
                    likely to take advantage of the Ryzen AI 300’s NPU core
                    (Adobe and Blender are listed as ISV partners), will allow
                    you to use their AI features on device — no need to connect
                    a distant AI server.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Intel's Lunar Lake chips are also expected to be in laptops
                    getting Copilot+ branding sometime this year, but we don't
                    know the dates just yet.

                    Researchers have discovered that microplastics, once
                    ingested, travel from the gut to tissues such as the liver,
                    kidneys, and brain, potentially causing significant health
                    issues. The team’s findings emphasize the critical link
                    between gut health and overall well-being, with ongoing
                    studies exploring how diet and gut microbiota interact with
                    microplastic absorption. Credit: SciTechDaily.com

                    It’s happening every day. From our water, our food, and even
                    the air we breathe, tiny plastic particles are finding their
                    way into many parts of our body.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But what happens once those particles are inside? What do
                    they do to our digestive system?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a recent paper published in the journal
                    <em>Environmental Health Perspectives</em>,
                    <a

                    >
                    researchers found that those tiny particles – microplastics
                    – are having a significant impact on our digestive pathways,
                    making their way from the gut and into the tissues of the
                    kidney, liver, and brain.

                  <p>
                    Research continues to show the importance of gut health. If
                    you don’t have a healthy gut, it affects the brain, it
                    affects the liver and so many other tissues. So even
                    imagining that the microplastics are doing something in the
                    in the gut, that chronic exposure could lead to systemic
                    effects.

                    [...] While other researchers are helping to identify and
                    quantify ingested microplastics, Castillo and his team focus
                    on what the microplastics are doing inside the body,
                    specifically to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and to the
                    gut immune system.

                    Over a four-week period, Castillo, postdoctoral fellow
                    Marcus Garcia, PharmD, and other UNM researchers exposed
                    mice to microplastics in their drinking water. The amount
                    was equivalent to the quantity of microplastics humans are
                    believed to ingest each week.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microplastics had migrated out of the gut into the tissues
                    of the liver, kidney and even the brain, the team found. The
                    study also showed the microplastics changed metabolic
                    pathways in the affected tissues.

                    Boeing and Airbus said Friday that planes containing the
                    parts are safe to fly, but Boeing said it was removing
                    affected parts from planes that haven't been delivered yet
                    to airline customers.

                    It will be up to regulators including the Federal Aviation
                    Administration to decide whether any work needs to be done
                    to planes that are already carrying passengers.

                  <p>
                    The FAA said it is "investigating the scope and impact of
                    the issue." The agency said Boeing reported the problem
                    covering material from a distributor "who may have falsified
                    or provided incorrect records." The FAA did not name the
                    distributor.

                    A complaint that Tesla has misled consumers with the name of
                    its Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Autopilot features, brought
                    by the California Department of Motor Vehicles, will be

                    Tesla had previously defended the use of the term, which is
                    now known as “Full Self-Driving (Supervised),” as a

                    California DMV could continue on Monday, according to
                    Bloomberg.

                  <p>
                    The decision comes as Tesla faces federal investigations
                    into FSD technology, which is often blamed when Tesla
                    vehicles are involved in crashes. Officially, Tesla
                    acknowledges that FSD doesn’t allow the average user to
                    ignore the road completely, something that the average
                    person would probably understand as a fully autonomous
                    vehicle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But CEO Elon Musk has long been predicting that FSD will
                    allow for completely autonomous transportation. And as
                    recently as last week, he touted the latest version by
                    suggesting it may be even more powerful than the name
                    sounds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “FSD 12.4.1 releases today to Tesla employees,” Musk tweeted
                    on
                    <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1798374945644277841"
                      >June 5</a
                    >. “If that goes well, then it will be released to a limited
                    number of external customers this weekend. There are a
                    massive number of changes to this build. It should arguably
                    be called v13, but we’re sticking to 12.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Musk even claimed that soon people will be able to use
                    FSD for as long as a year before a human needs to intervene,
                    though he included a very important caveat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Two other versions are in earlier stages of testing: 12.5
                    and 12.6, which could be called v14 and v15. We are starting
                    to get to the point where, once known bugs are fixed, it
                    will take over a year of driving to get even one
                    intervention,” Musk wrote.

                Although it might seem that the site is not progressing there is
                nothing that could be further from the truth...

              <p><b>The New Company and Transfer Of Assets</b></p>
              <p>
                A new company has now been formed, along with IRS agreement that
                we are a registered as a 501(c)(3) company (donations will be
                tax deductible for anyone under the US IRS system) , and we have
                our own bank account and Board. Therefore, I informed the
                current Board of this at the end of last week requesting that we
                initiate the transfer of site ownership and its assets. I also
                proposed a way that we could do this with the minimum of
                disruption to the site itself. Ideally, it should from the
                community point of view be nothing more than a redirection of
                URLs to different IP addresses. The proposal has to be studied
                and accepted by the current Board, or they might suggest an
                alternative proposal. NCommander is moving home for much of this
                week and so I do not expect a response in the next few days.
              </p>
              <p><b>Site Downtime</b></p>
              <p>
                We are experiencing a recurring problem with a drive that keeps
                filling up. Several of our community have offered suggestions
                which have been implemented but they do not appear to be having
                the desired effect. Further investigation is ongoing but, for
                now at least, the problem has been resolved by freeing up space
                by moving files that did not have to be on that particular drive
                to a different drive on that server. I would like to thank the
                community for their patience but there are only 3 people who
                have easy access to that particular server, and I am one of
                them. The configuration of the infrastructure is not
                straightforward, and I am not a sys-admin. So to some extent we
                are still reliant on NCommander and kolie for some of the
                technical expertise or advice that is sometimes necessary, and
                to whom I am grateful for any assistance that they can give.
              </p>
              <p><b>Submissions</b></p>
              <p>
                We have had a small number of our community helping by making
                submissions that meet our stated interests and topics of
                discussion. There has also been a handful of submissions on the
                '/dev/random' topic which have also received a very healthy
                number of comments. But for the majority we are still relying on
                upstart and Arthur (both bots) to bring fresh material to our
                submission queue. Any relevant submissions from the community
                would be welcome and I encourage you to think about the more
                unusual and loosely-tech-related topics that you would like to
                see discussed. A fully prepared submission would be ideal but if
                all we get is a URL then that is just putting a greater workload
                on the small number of active editors that we currently have.
                Try to at least provide some kind of summary and perhaps ask
                your own questions to prompt the community to respond. We can do
                all of the formatting to meet the site's needs for you. But if
                all you have is a URL then we will try to make a submission from
                it. Off-topic submissions that are just a URL will probably not
                be processed.
              </p>
              <p><b>Spamming</b></p>
              <p>
                There has been a significant reduction in the amount of spamming
                anywhere on the site over the last few weeks. It hasn't gone
                completely but it is currently manageable by normal moderation
                by the community, and occasionally by the staff.
              </p>
              <p><b>Complaints</b></p>
              <p>
                Complaining about things you don't like on the site by means of
                public comments is not recommended and is usually a waste of
                your time and ours. If it is something that can be rectified
                immediately then we will, of course, do so but anything more
                significant takes a lot of time for the few staff that we have.
                Complaining anonymously will not be actioned. If you wish to
                make a complaint then we must have a way of contacting you
                privately. This can be any email address that you choose,
                providing that it lasts until the problem can be investigated
                and any necessary action taken to remedy the problem. We will
                probably have further questions to help us resolve the Issue and
                we will also need to inform you of the progress of our
                investigations and the final decision. That will be at least
                several days as an absolute minimum. If you keep repeating the
                same complaint anonymously in different threads and over a
                period of time it will be treated as spam - as was explained
                about 3 years ago in a Meta by Martyb.
              </p>
              <p>
                If it is not important enough to justify an email then it is
                possibly your personal problem and not something on the site
                that must be changed. Any alternative response could result in
                the staff being tied up in malicious anonymous complaints which
                we have not got the resources to address.

                    A groundbreaking study led by the USC Leonard Davis School
                    of Gerontology in collaboration with Dominican University of
                    California explores how small molecules derived from sea
                    sponges affect energy production in mitochondria and details
                    their remarkably targeted effects on various types of
                    cancers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The research focused on mycothiazole (MTZ), a molecule
                    found in the marine sponge C. mycofijiensis, and its
                    synthetic analog 8-O-acetylmycothiazole (8-OAc). These
                    molecules demonstrated significant efficiency in inhibiting
                    the function of electron transport chain (ETC) complex I, a
                    key component of mitochondrial energy production.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study compared both molecules to the more extensively
                    studied ETC inhibitor rotenone. Mainly used as an
                    agricultural pesticide, rotenone has exhibited anti-cancer
                    properties in human cells in previous studies. However, in
                    this study, rotenone also displayed significant toxicity to

                    Both MTZ and 8-OAc exhibited higher toxicity against liver
                    carcinoma, breast cancer, and glioblastoma cells compared to
                    non-cancerous cells in vitro, demonstrating markedly better
                    selectivity than rotenone. Notably, 8-OAc, which is more
                    shelf-stable than MTZ, showed the best selectivity for
                    cancer cells versus healthy cells, highlighting its
                    potential in future therapeutic development, Sanabria said.

                    "When we test the drugs in human cells, they preferentially
                    target cancer cells for cell death pathways. It does so very
                    robustly; we're getting anywhere from 60% to 80% cell death
                    in cancer cells," they said.

                  <p>
                    "But when we treat non-cancer cells with the exact same
                    concentrations, we're getting very little effect. Not only
                    are we not seeing any cell death, these drugs basically have
                    no change to the transcriptome of non-cancer cells, which
                    suggests that it's really doing nothing to the non-cancerous
                    cells at the same concentrations that it's able to kill
                    cancer cells."

                    DeepComputing has announced a successor to its Roma laptop,
                    which was the first notebook of its kind to use a
                    RISC-V-compatible processor.

                  <p>
                    Called DC-Roma RISC-V Laptop II, the device is claimed to be
                    the first RV-based laptop in the world to run Ubuntu out of
                    the box. It's not the first RISC-V laptop to use Linux in
                    general as the

                    came with Alibaba's own Linux-based OS, OpenAnolis. However,
                    given that Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux
                    distributions, it's certainly a milestone for the upcoming
                    instruction set architecture (ISA).

                  <p>
                    "As RISC-V is becoming a competitive ISA in multiple
                    markets, porting Ubuntu to RISC-V to become the reference OS

                    features a SoC from a relatively obscure Chinese firm,
                    SpacemiT. This isn't unusual for DeepComputing, which is
                    based in Hong Kong and previously relied on an SoC from
                    StarFive, a different Chinese chip designer, for the
                    original Roma laptop.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That might sound strange to anyone following developments in
                    RISC-V laptops, since it was initially reported even by
                    RISC-V International itself that the Roma laptop used a chip
                    from Alibaba. However, as far as <em>The Register</em> can
                    tell, Roma shipped with StarFive's JH7110, which features a
                    quad-core CPU clocked at 1.5 GHz, an integrated GPU made by
                    Imagination, and no neural processing unit (NPU) at all,
                    despite what DeepComputing's official product page says.

                  <p>
                    [...] Additionally, the 2 TOPS NPU doesn't seem like it can
                    really back up Canonical's claims of "powerful AI
                    capabilities." For reference, 2 TOPS is small even compared
                    to the old Google Edge TPU with its 4 TOPS, and nowhere near
                    Hailo's latest, low-end Hailo-8L,

                  <p>
                    [...] Regardless of actual performance, DeepComputing and
                    Canonical can at least claim to have achieved a first, one
                    that's especially important for RISC-V's ambitions in the PC
                    market. RISC-V has to start somewhere, and being able to
                    offer the full Linux experience in a regular laptop is a
                    significant step.

                    Wealthy owners of Rum treated this island as a shooting and
                    fishing estate for more than a century and kept most people
                    away from what became known as the "Forbidden Isle" during
                    the late 19th- to early 20th-century.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When Kinloch castle was built by the textile tycoon George
                    Bullough in 1897, his wife, Lady Monica wanted to grow roses
                    in the garden. To facilitate this and generally improve the
                    landscape, Bullough imported 250,000 tonnes of good-quality
                    Ayrshire soil to spread around their new home. They lived in
                    this castle for just six weeks each year, but this human
                    opulence changed the underground ecosystem significantly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The imported soil contained earthworms and this invertebrate
                    community around the castle at Kinloch grew. Now, 12 species
                    of earthworms—ones that prefer neutral pH soils—are present
                    at high abundance (200 worms per square metre).

                    steep, rocky peak called Hallival. Our research showed that
                    this earthworm species richness and abundance ends abruptly
                    at the wall around the estate—the limit of the imported
                    soil.

                  <p>
                    As well as human influences, natural processes can affect
                    soil properties. On the slopes of Rum's peaks, many patches
                    of bright green vegetation can be found among the rocks at
                    elevations from 500-800m. These so-called "shearwater
                    greens" are the result of nesting Manx shearwaters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pairs of these black and white seabirds burrow into the
                    hillside to raise one chick each year, before beginning
                    their long-distance migration towards South America. The
                    verdant shearwater greens are
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2012.07.004"
                      >fertilized from above by the feces</a
                    >
                    of the adult birds before they fly off to forage for small
                    fish such as herring and sprat to feed their chicks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More nutrient-rich feces from the digested fish are also
                    produced by the chicks in the burrow below ground, so soil
                    enrichment is from a marine source. This supports grass
                    growth and more earthworms—the same three species found on
                    the moorland, but in much greater numbers.

                  <p>
                    On low-lying moorland, fenced plots keep deer away from
                    trees that were planted in the 1950s and 1960s, just after
                    Rum became a national nature reserve. Now, these protected
                    trees provide roosts for songbirds, and the soil beneath
                    them is rich with earthworms as the tree leaf litter adds
                    nutrients to the soil. These plots have triggered a
                    small-scale reafforestation project which could change this
                    island landscape, its soils and its many earthworms.

                    For years, Xbox was a footnote on Microsoft's expenses list,
                    but now it's spending billions of dollars on acquiring
                    studios, it's under a lot more scrutiny. The worst case
                    scenario is that you invest in the Xbox plantation, only for
                    Microsoft to pull the plug on the whole thing. Your games,
                    unavailable. Your console, bricked. It seems hyperbolic but
                    recent years of games being pulled from existence sets a
                    precedent. At some point, it could happen to an entire
                    ecosystem.

                    The horse transformed human history—and now scientists have
                    a clearer idea of when humans began to transform the horse.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Around 4,200 years ago, one particular lineage of horse
                    quickly became dominant across Eurasia, suggesting that's
                    when humans started to spread domesticated horses around the
                    world, according to research
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07597-5"
                      >published Thursday in the journal <i>Nature</i></a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There was something special about this horse: It had a
                    genetic mutation that changed the shape of its back, likely
                    making it easier to ride.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In the past, you had many different lineages of horses,"
                    said Pablo Librado, an evolutionary biologist at the Spanish
                    National Research Council in Barcelona and co-author of the
                    new study. That genetic diversity was evident in ancient DNA
                    samples the researchers analyzed from archaeological sites
                    across Eurasia dating back to 50,000 years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But their analysis of 475 ancient horse genomes showed a
                    notable change around 4,200 years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's when a specific lineage that first arose in what's
                    known as the Pontic-Caspian Steppe, a plains region that
                    stretches from what is now northeastern Bulgaria across
                    Ukraine and through southern Russia, began to pop up all
                    across Eurasia and quickly replaced other lineages. Within
                    three hundred years, the horses in Spain were similar to
                    those in Russia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We saw this genetic type spreading almost everywhere in
                    Eurasia—clearly this horse type that was local became global
                    very fast," said co-author Ludovic Orlando, a molecular
                    archaeologist at the Centre for Anthropobiology and Genomics
                    of Toulouse in France.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Researchers believe the very earliest horse ancestors
                    arose in North America, then sauntered across the Bering
                    Strait into Asia around a million years ago. They flourished
                    in Asia, but went extinct in the Americas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    People had domesticated other animals several thousand years
                    before horses—including dogs, pigs, cattle, goats and sheep.
                    But the new research shows that the shrinking genetic
                    diversity associated with domestication happened much faster
                    in horses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Humans changed the horse genome stunningly quickly, perhaps
                    because we already had experience dealing with animals,"
                    said Laurent Frantz, who studies the genetics of ancient
                    creatures at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and
                    was not involved in the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It shows the special place of horses in human societies."

                <div>
                  <p>Here’s what to know about the long COVID definition.</p>
                  <p>
                    It’s a medical condition that belongs to a family of chronic
                    conditions that kick in after infections with viruses,
                    bacteria, fungi or parasites. That includes chronic health
                    problems such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue
                    syndrome (ME/CFS) and Lyme-associated chronic illnesses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the National Academies’ definition, long COVID
                    is a medical condition that persists for at least three
                    months after an infection with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus
                    that causes COVID-19. Long COVID can affect any organ or
                    system in the body. People may have any of more than 200
                    symptoms, which may include difficulty breathing,

                    >
                    and autoimmune diseases such as lupus (<em>SN: 2/2/22</em>;
                    <em>SN: 8/21/23</em>; <em>SN: 1/4/22</em>). Those symptoms
                    can appear alone or in multiple combinations, can be
                    continuous, get progressively worse or have bouts in which
                    the patient gets better and then worse again.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chronic symptoms can affect people who originally had mild
                    to severe COVID and can even strike people who didn’t have
                    any symptoms at all from their original infection. For that
                    reason, the committee that crafted the Academies’ definition
                    says that people don’t need to have had a positive COVID
                    test to be diagnosed with long COVID.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The condition can strike adults and children and can start
                    weeks or months after seeming recovery from the initial
                    infection. The committee didn’t put an upper limit on how
                    long after getting the original illness that long COVID
                    could start.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are no blood tests or biomarkers that doctors can use
                    to reliably diagnose long COVID right now. The report calls
                    for continued research to find such diagnostic tools.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This definition follows a June 5 report that the Social
                    Security Administration asked the National Academies to
                    prepare. That report similarly found that

                    that can affect people’s physical function, quality of life
                    and their ability to work or perform in school for years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The definition is “intentionally inclusive,” the committee
                    says.

                    New Hampshire officials issued two warnings of potentially
                    dangerous algae blooms along parts of Lake Winnipesaukee,
                    the state's largest lake.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services said
                    on Thursday it detected high concentrations of
                    cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, at Carry and
                    Brewster beaches in Wolfeboro and at 19-Mile Bay and
                    Tuftonboro Neck in Tuftonboro the previous day.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Visitors should avoid contact with the water and keep pets
                    away, the department advised in a statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The cyanobacteria blooms are occurring as green clouds of
                    material accumulating along shorelines. In some areas, they
                    appear more yellow because they are mixed in with dense
                    pollen, the department said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Symptoms of cyanobacteria exposure can include skin
                    irritation, stomach cramps, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea,
                    fever, sore throat, headache, muscle and joint pain, mouth
                    blisters and acute liver damage, the department said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The affected areas will be resampled on June 19 and
                    resampling will continue weekly if the bloom continues, the
                    department said.

                    Usable engineering data began to be returned later in April,

                    sending data immediately. According to NASA, the cosmic ray
                    subsystem and low energy charged particle instrument
                    required a little more tweaking but are now operational.

                  <p>
                    The rescue was made all the more impressive by the fact that
                    it takes 22.5 hours for a command to reach Voyager 1 and
                    another 22.5 hours for a response to be received on Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    How much longer the Voyagers can continue to function is
                    open to conjecture. The power supplies are gradually
                    degrading, and engineers have been turning off non-essential
                    systems to eke out dwindling resources for as long as
                    possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Due the engineers' efforts, there is a very good chance that
                    one or both Voyagers will continue to be operational by the
                    time the 50th anniversary of the mission's launch rolls
                    around in 2027.

                    NASA confirmed that Boeing's CST-100 Starliner spacecraft
                    has suffered a fifth, although minor, helium leak in its
                    propulsion system as engineers work to prepare the vehicle
                    for its return to Earth next week.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a June 10 statement, NASA mentioned that spacecraft teams
                    were examining "what impacts, if any, five small leaks in
                    the service module helium manifolds would have on the
                    remainder of the mission." That was the first reference to
                    there being five leaks in the spacecraft; NASA had mentioned
                    there were four in a briefing hours after the spacecraft's
                    June 6 docking with the International Space Station.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] NASA closed the helium manifolds in the propulsion
                    system after docking to stop the leaks, although they will
                    have to be opened to use the spacecraft's thrusters for
                    undocking and deorbit maneuvers. NASA said June 10 that
                    engineers estimate that Starliner has enough helium to
                    support 70 hours of flight operations, while only seven
                    hours is needed for Starliner to return to Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Those teams have some time to complete that work. NASA
                    had initially scheduled a June 14 undocking for Starliner,
                    but NASA said June 9 it was delaying the undocking to no
                    earlier than June 18. That delay was to avoid a conflict
                    with a June 13 ISS spacewalk, or EVA, by NASA astronauts
                    Tracy Dyson and Matt Dominick.

                    A groundbreaking cancer treatment developed by NUS
                    researchers utilizes engineered bacteria to deliver
                    chemotherapy drugs directly to tumor sites, significantly
                    enhancing treatment efficacy and reducing side effects.

                    Traditional chemotherapy frequently presents substantial
                    difficulties, such as harsh side effects, harm to healthy
                    cells, and restricted effectiveness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National
                    University of Singapore (NUS Medicine), have pioneered a
                    groundbreaking cancer treatment method. This new technique
                    offers a more precise, potent, and less harmful alternative
                    to conventional chemotherapy. It not only enhances the
                    efficacy of the treatment but also substantially lowers the
                    dosage of drugs needed for cancer therapy.

                    [...] Prodrugs are inactive molecules that transform into
                    active drugs within the body, particularly in tumor
                    environments, by leveraging unique tumor conditions, such as
                    low oxygen or high acidity, to activate the drug precisely
                    at the cancer site, minimizing damage to healthy tissues.
                    However, current prodrug strategies exhibit limited target
                    specificity and frequently depend on macromolecular
                    carriers, which complicates both drug distribution and
                    clearance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To overcome these limitations, NUS Medicine researchers
                    developed a prodrug delivery method that utilizes a
                    commensal <em>Lactobacillus</em> strain that binds
                    specifically to cancer cells via a surface molecule called
                    heparan sulfate. These engineered bacteria carry a prodrug
                    that converts to the chemotherapy drug SN-38 at the tumor
                    site. In preclinical models of nasopharyngeal cancer, the
                    engineered bacteria localized specifically in the tumor and
                    released the chemotherapy drug directly at the cancer site,
                    reducing tumor growth by 67% and increasing the
                    effectiveness of the chemotherapy drug by 54%.

                    [...] “Cancer treatment often takes a tremendously heavy
                    toll on patients. Our research represents a significant step
                    toward developing a more targeted and less toxic approach to
                    fighting cancer. We hope this can pave the way for therapies
                    that are both mild and effective,” added A/Prof Chang,

                    Because the two versions of Google Pay were separate
                    codebases, Google didn't upgrade users from the old app to
                    the new app. They lived on the Play Store as separate apps,
                    both called "Google Pay," and for a while, it was possible
                    to download and install both apps on your device. A big use
                    case for the app was P2P payments, but money sent via the
                    new app didn't arrive on the old app, and vice versa, so for
                    months of the transition, Google Pay just wasn't a reliable
                    money-sending service that
                    <a href="https://x.com/RonAmadeo/status/1407131954521255940"

                  <p>
                    Google often feels like a disorganized company with
                    constantly shifting priorities, and a big reason behind that
                    is the lack of top-down initiatives from the CEO. That means
                    the real driving force behind most projects at Google are
                    mid-level executives who show up with grand plans and then
                    leave—either in disgrace or triumph—when those initial plans
                    run their course. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Lost in all of this app shuffling is that Google
                    supposedly has no P2P payments system now. Wallet only
                    supports tap-to-pay, gift cards, and driver's licenses—it
                    doesn't have a way to send money to friends, family, or
                    anybody else. This worked fine on Google Pay before Google
                    blew everything up. Now, it is presumably ceding that market
                    to apps like Venmo and Zelle, though it's hard to imagine
                    anyone sticking with Google's payment app after the
                    confusing and broken transition.

                    earthquake, and the gap was mostly filled by solar power,
                    centralized battery storage, and hydropower. But the entire

                    However, the potential of these battery-swap stations has
                    not been fully achieved yet; the majority of the stations
                    have not started giving energy back to the grid.

                    In most modern vehicles, these systems are “passive” in that
                    they don’t physically slow a speeding vehicle. A
                    notification may pop up if you’re going more than a few
                    miles per hour over the speed limit, but it won’t physically
                    limit your ability to speed. Active ISA systems will
                    physically slow your vehicle to keep you at the speed limit.
                    Some use tactile responses, like pushing the accelerator
                    back into your foot, while others actively limit the engine
                    power to keep you at the speed limit. These active systems
                    can be turned on and off by the driver.

                    [...] While conflicts around speed limiters are not new,
                    they have certainly become more deeply ingrained, thanks in
                    part to the covid-19 pandemic and political division.
                    According to Adkins, speeding got worse when everyone was
                    forced to stay home. “The people that were out, were
                    speeding, they were way more aggressive because they knew
                    they had the space, and they knew they could get away with
                    it,” he said.

                    [...] While Americans love the freedom to drive where they
                    want, as fast as they want, a study released today from the
                    Insurance Institute for Highway Safety shows that consumers
                    may be more open to technology like ISA than previously
                    thought. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Ian Reagan, a senior research scientist at the
                    institute who designed the survey, more than 60 percent of
                    the 1,800 drivers who participated said they would be open
                    to some form of passive ISA system in new cars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even more surprising was that 50 percent of those surveyed
                    said they’d be open to active ISA, including tech that makes
                    the accelerator pedal harder to press or automatically
                    restricts speed. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety data
                    notes that drivers would have the option to turn any active
                    ISA system on and off as they see fit, making the technology
                    only useful if it’s accepted and utilized by drivers. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While this is a small bright spot when it comes to
                    potentially reducing speed-related accidents on US roads,
                    there is still a long way to go. After all, it took nearly
                    50 years of advocacy from groups like Mothers Against Drunk
                    Driving to stigmatize driving under the influence. And it
                    took nearly that long for drivers to get on board with
                    wearing their seatbelts. “I think we’ll get there,” Adkins
                    said, “but it’s going to take some time, and we have to do
                    this thoughtfully.”

                    are often huge and heavy devices that need a stable platform

                    that its researchers have worked closely with a team from
                    the University of Texas at Austin to create a prototype 3D
                    printer that is smaller than a coin.

                  <p>
                    This photonic chip focuses its beam into a resin well that
                    rapidly cures when it’s hit by a particular wavelength of
                    light emitted from the chip. The palm-sized 3D printer also
                    saves space by eschewing moving parts — instead of using
                    arms and motors to change the beam’s focal point, the
                    prototype uses tiny optical antennas to move it around and
                    create the desired shape.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the team is successful in turning this concept into a
                    viable product, it could change the face of instant
                    manufacturing. The portability and speed of this palm-sized
                    printer could allow anyone — engineers, doctors, or even
                    first responders — to create solutions on the fly without
                    needing to lug around a big and heavy device.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] These are just some of the exciting possibilities that
                    this 3D printing concept brings to the table. According to
                    MIT Professor Jelena Notaros, “This system is completely
                    rethinking what a 3D printer is. It is no longer a big box
                    sitting on a bench in a lab creating objects, but something
                    that is handheld and portable. It is exciting to think about
                    the new applications that could come out of this and how the
                    field of 3D printing could change.”

                    Following the strongest solar storm in twenty years, NASA’s
                    ICESat-2 satellite was put into a safe hold on May 10 due to
                    atmospheric drag from the expanded atmosphere. Recovery
                    actions have since raised its orbit, with operations
                    anticipated to restart on June 17.

                    The lidar instrument on NASA’s ICESat-2 satellite is
                    scheduled to resume collecting data around June 17, after
                    going into a safe hold on May 10 due to impacts from the
                    strongest solar storm to hit Earth in two decades. The storm
                    did not cause any detectable damage to the satellite or its
                    instrument.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    were released from the Sun and sparked a geomagnetic storm
                    at Earth that caused our planet’s atmosphere to expand in
                    places. This created unexpected drag on ICESat-2, rotating
                    the satellite, and triggering the satellite to enter safe
                    hold, which turned off ICESat-2’s science instrument.

                    The ICESat-2 team has conducted two thruster burns to raise
                    the spacecraft’s altitude, allowing it to now drift back to
                    its normal orbit around 310 miles (500 kilometers) above
                    Earth. Once there, the team will return the Advanced
                    Topographic Laser Altimeter System instrument to science
                    mode, to continue measuring the height of Earth’s ice,
                    water, forests, and land cover.

                    ICESat-2, short for Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation
                    Satellite-2, is a NASA satellite mission designed to measure
                    ice sheet elevation and sea ice thickness, as well as land
                    topography and vegetation characteristics. Launched in
                    September 2018, the satellite employs a sophisticated laser
                    altimeter system called ATLAS (Advanced Topographic Laser
                    Altimeter System) to provide precise and detailed
                    measurements of Earth’s surface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ICESat-2’s high-resolution data helps scientists understand
                    changes in ice sheets, glaciers, and sea ice that result
                    from climate change, enhancing our ability to accurately
                    predict future sea level rise and assess changes in Earth’s
                    ecosystems. This satellite is a critical tool in NASA’s
                    Earth Observing System, contributing valuable data for
                    environmental research and climate science.

                    Unfortunately for big ISPs, legal history hasn’t been in
                    their favor. This particular debate has wound through the
                    legal system several times now, and each time the courts
                    have ruled that the FCC has the legal right to reclassify
                    broadband and impose net neutrality under the Telecom Act —
                    provided they provide hard data supporting their decisions.

                    Microsoft isn't just making Recall opt-in either. The
                    company also announced that in order to enable Recall, users
                    will have to enroll in Windows Hello, a security feature
                    that requires users to sign in via facial recognition,
                    fingerprint, or a PIN.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That same authentication will be required for a user to
                    access or search through their Recall history timeline as
                    well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Plus, Microsoft says it's "adding additional layers of data
                    protection." Recall snapshots will only be decrypted and
                    accessible after a user authenticates. The search index
                    database will also now be encrypted too.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft's blog post about the Recall security update also
                    runs through a number of security-related provisions that
                    were already built in, such as the screenshots only being
                    available locally on the device. The feature already
                    provided imagery to show it was being used – a Recall icon
                    pinned to the taskbar on a user's desktop. However, many
                    users would've likely been unaware of what the icon meant if
                    Recall had just been on as a default.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new opt-in option should hopefully make it crystal clear
                    that a user is consenting to what Recall does.

                  <p>
                    Someone recently asked an interesting question: Why do
                    Microsoft C and compatible DOS compilers have no truncate()
                    and/or ftruncate() library functions? And how does one
                    resize files on DOS?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    OK, that's actually two questions. The first one is easy
                    enough to answer: Because XENIX had no truncate() or
                    ftruncate() either. Instead, XENIX had a chsize() function
                    which, sure enough, can be found in the Microsoft C
                    libraries at least as far back as MS C 3.0 (early 1985).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second question is rather more interesting. The way
                    files are resized on DOS is moving the file pointer to the
                    desired size by calling the LSEEK function (INT 21h/42h),
                    and then calling the WRITE function (INT 21h/40h) with zero
                    length (CX=0).
                  </p>

                    Now, this mechanism is rather curious, because the
                    handle-based file API in DOS 2.0 was modeled on XENIX, yet
                    on UNIX systems, the write() function asked to transfer zero
                    bytes simply does nothing. If the mechanism didn't come from
                    XENIX, where did it come from?....

                    For the new study, a team of international researchers used
                    an artificial intelligence algorithm to analyse the calls of
                    two wild herds of African savannah elephants in Kenya.

                    The research "not only shows that elephants use specific
                    vocalisations for each individual, but that they recognise
                    and react to a call addressed to them while ignoring those
                    addressed to others," lead study author Michael Pardo said.

                    generated by elephants using their vocal cords, similar to
                    how people speak - made by more than 100 elephants in

                    identifying a specific elephant as the intended addressee.
                    The researchers then played audio for 17 elephants to test
                    how they would respond to a call apparently addressed to
                    them as well as to a call apparently addressed to some other

                    O-positive is the most common blood type, 35% of donors have
                    it, and it can be given to anybody with any positive blood
                    type. This means three in every four people, or 76% of the
                    population, can benefit from an O positive donation.

                A very interesting article about programming Robots, written by
                BENJIE HOLSON:

                    I worked on this idea for months before I decided it was a
                    mistake. The second time I heard someone mention it, I
                    thought, "That's strange, these two groups had the same
                    idea. Maybe I should tell them it didn't work for us." The
                    third and fourth time I rolled my eyes and ignored it. The
                    fifth time I heard about a group struggling with this
                    mistake I decided it was worth a blog post all on its own. I
                    call this idea "The Mythical Non-Roboticist".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The idea goes something like this: Programming robots is
                    hard. And there are some people with really arcane skills
                    and PhDs who are really expensive and seem to be required
                    for some reason. Wouldn't it be nice if we could do robotics
                    without them?1 What if everyone could do robotics? That
                    would be great, right? We should make a software framework
                    so that non-roboticists can program robots.

                    This idea is so close to a correct idea that it's hard to
                    tell why it doesn't work out. On the surface, it's not
                    wrong: all else being equal, it would be good if programming
                    robots was more accessible. The problem is that we don't
                    have a good recipe for making working robots. So we don't
                    know how to make that recipe easier to follow. In order to
                    make things simple, people end up removing things that folks
                    might need, because no one knows for sure what's absolutely
                    required. It's like saying you want to invent an
                    invisibility cloak and want to be able to make it from
                    materials you can buy from Home Depot. Sure, that would be
                    nice, but if you invented an invisibility cloak that
                    required some mercury and neodymium to manufacture would you
                    toss the recipe?

                  <p>
                    In robotics, this mistake is based on a very true and very
                    real observation: programming robots is super hard. Famously
                    hard. It would be super-great if programming robots was
                    easier. The issue is this: programming robots has two
                    different kinds of hard parts.

                    [...] As with the earlier find, there seem to be two
                    possible explanations for the ASKAP source. One is a neutron
                    star that's still managing to emit radiofrequency radiation
                    from its poles despite rotating extremely slowly. The second
                    is a white dwarf that has a reasonable rotation period but
                    an unreasonably strong magnetic field.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To get at this issue, the researchers estimate the strength
                    of the magnetic field needed to produce the larger bursts
                    and come up with a value that's significantly higher than
                    any previously observed to originate on a white dwarf. So
                    they strongly argue for the source being a neutron star.
                    Whether that argues for the earlier source being a neutron
                    star will depend on whether you feel that the two objects
                    represent a single phenomenon despite their somewhat
                    different behaviors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In any case, we now have two of these mystery slow-repeat
                    objects to explain. It's possible that we'll be able to
                    learn more about this newer one if we can get some
                    information as to what's involved in its mode switching. But
                    then we'll have to figure out if what we learn applies to
                    the one we discovered earlier.

                    Microsoft is revamping how Recall works amid its PR
                    nightmare<br />By<br />Rich Woods
                  </p>
                  <p>Key Takeaways</p>
                  <p>
                            -Microsoft promised groundbreaking features with
                    Copilot+, including Cocreator and Live Captions, but Recall
                    has become a PR nightmare.<br />
                            -Concerns about Recall being a security risk have
                    led to backlash and panic among users due to data access
                    vulnerabilities.<br />
                            -Microsoft has been silent on Recall issues but is
                    finally taking action to address the security concerns and
                    ensure user control.

                    One of the key complaints about Recall is that it was
                    opt-out. In the setup experience, Windows just tells you
                    that it's on, and lets you check a box to open settings
                    after setup is complete. Now, you'll have to choose to turn
                    it on during the out-of-box experience, so it's totally
                    opt-in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Secondly, you'll have to use Windows Hello in order to turn
                    on Recall. The idea is that in order to access it, Windows
                    will have to know it's you.<br />
                      Finally, Windows is going to use just-in-time decryption,
                    meaning everything will be encrypted until you've been
                    authenticated. Microsoft also confirmed that it's encrypted
                    the search index database, which was one of the key
                    call-outs in the report from earlier this week.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft also noted that all Copilot+ PCs are Secured-core,
                    so they're designed to be secure. They have Microsoft Pluton
                    security chips, so there's hardware-level protection going
                    on there.<br />

                And, all of this makes sense because we know that security chips
                can't be hacked, because they are secure chips, right? /sarcasm

                Oh yeah, the data never leaves your PC. Unless, of course, you
                do a backup to the cloud, right? In which case your data may be
                in Sri Lanka, Timbuktu, Israel, or, maybe even Ireland. And,
                police forces in third world banana republics never get warrants
                for whatever might be on the server.

              <p>
                The best thing Microsoft can do with CoPilot, is to deep six it.
                Better yet, deep six all of their "telemetry" along with
                CoPilot.

                Motor Trend is running a story that summarizes a number of

                I tried it on a 10 year old car and it pretty much matched what
                I expected -- no Wi-Fi, no linking to phones, but possible data
                collected if satellite radio was used (it's not).

                    Of all the data that car companies can potentially capture,
                    one of the most eye-opening from the Mozilla report was
                    people having sex in vehicles. "One of the things that
                    everybody latched onto was Nissan and Kia saying they could
                    collect information on your sex life or your sexual
                    activity," Caltrider said. "That really freaked people out."
                    While the researchers couldn't determine exactly how the
                    automakers would gather data on sexual activity in cars, the
                    educated guess is it wouldn't be that hard for cameras and
                    sensors to gather the information necessary.

                  <p>
                    After the Mozilla Foundation report was released, Kia
                    Connect Services (a suite of services Kia extends to its
                    vehicle owners) and Nissan USA removed wording about
                    collecting information on sexual activity from their online
                    privacy policies, Caltrider said. She sent us a PDF of the
                    original wording on the Nissan site, and under Types of
                    Personal Data collected, it read: "Sensitive personal
                    information, including ... sexual orientation, sexual
                    activity, precise geolocation, health diagnosis data, and
                    genetic information." On Kia's broader corporate privacy
                    page under Sensitive Personal Information as of press time,
                    it still read, "This category may include ... sex life or

                Historically, high-speed rail travel by
                <i>Train a Grande Vitesse</i> (TGV) in France was the monopoly
                of the French national rail service, SNCF.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under EU rules, all national operators have to make their rail
                system available to other willing operators. So in 2021,
                Trentalia, a unit of Italy's state rail operator, decided to
                offer high-speed train rides in France too.

                    As France's first independent high speed train operator,

                It might be noteworthy that earlier this year, the EU decided to
                speed-up the implementation of the TEN-T network. The TEN-T is
                an EU-wide network of rail, inland waterways, short-sea shipping
                routes, and roads. It connects 424 major cities with ports,
                airports and railway terminals. When the TEN-T is complete, it
                will cut travel times between these cities. For example,
                passengers will be able to travel between Copenhagen and Hamburg
                in 2.5 hours by train, instead of the 4.5 hours required today.

                    During an interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,
                    comedian Larry David explained that his New Year's
                    Resolution was "make two trips" (episode 857, January 8,
                    2020).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, when carrying groceries into the house, it is
                    tempting to carry everything at once, but then you drop the
                    cantaloupe, and now you have to clean up that mess. While it
                    seemed like one trip would have been faster, if you include
                    the time it takes to clean up the mess, it would have been
                    faster to simply make two trips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This "make two trips" strategy isn't an
                    earth-shattering breakthrough. It won't cure cancer, end
                    world hunger, or fix the climate crisis. However, I have
                    adopted this philosophy, and it has had many benefits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The immediate benefit is that I am now more likely to have a
                    free hand to open my house door. Pulling keys out of my
                    pocket no longer involves smashing a grocery bag between my
                    chest and the house.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The larger benefit has come from adopting this philosophy in
                    both coding and operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The other day, I was adding a feature to some old code. The
                    code reported results of an earlier calculation with various
                    formatting options that could be enabled or disabled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The code was quite complex because certain options affected
                    the format in ways that had downstream implications for
                    other options. The code was able to satisfy all the various
                    options and controls in one pass over the data, printing a
                    report along the way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] I struggled in earnest to add my new feature to this
                    ever-growing complicated loop.
                  </p>
                  <p>Then I remembered Larry's advice: Make two trips.</p>

                    The code would be significantly simpler if it made two
                    passes over the data. One pass would collect data, count
                    things that needed to be counted, sum subtotals, and so on.
                    The second pass would take all this information and output
                    the report, and would be much easier because it had all the
                    information it needed from the start. No Schrödinger's cat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It was a classic complexity vs. memory engineering
                    decision: Suffer from complexity or suffer from potential
                    memory exhaustion.
