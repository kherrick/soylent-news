                    with California lawmakers to fund local news in the state
                    after previously protesting a proposed law that would have
                    required it to pay media outlets. Under the terms of the
                    deal, Google will commit tens of millions of dollars to a
                    fund supporting local news as well as an AI “accelerator
                    program” in the state.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The agreement ends a months-long dispute between lawmakers
                    and Google over the California Journalism Preservation Act,
                    a bill that would have required Google, Meta and other large
                    platforms to pay California publishers in exchange for
                    linking to their websites. Google strongly opposed the
                    measure, which was similar to laws passed in Canada and
                    Australia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Now, under the new agreement, Google will direct “at
                    least $55 million” to “a nonprofit public charity housed at
                    UC Berkeley’s journalism school,” <em>Politico</em>

                      >reports</a
                    >. The university will distribute the fund, which also
                    includes “at least $70 million” from the state of
                    California. Google will also “commit $50 million over five
                    years to unspecified ‘existing journalism programs.’”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The agreement also includes funding for a “National AI
                    Innovation Accelerator.” Details of that program are
                    unclear, but <em>Cal Matters</em>

                    that Google will dedicate “at least $17.5 million” to the
                    effort, which will fund AI experiments for local businesses
                    and other organizations, including newsrooms. That aspect of
                    the deal, which is so far unique to Google's agreement in
                    California, could end up being more controversial as it

                    certainly didn't think it was aliens. But he realized that
                    if the signals they were identifying had blazed brighter,
                    even momentarily, they would be very much like the Wow!
                    signal. As for the mechanism that caused such a brightening,
                    Mendez et al. propose that a

                    (a highly magnetic neutron star) passing behind a cloud of
                    atomic hydrogen could have flared up with sufficient energy
                    to produce

                    in the form of a tightly focused beam of microwave
                    radiation—a cosmic maser. (Masers are akin to lasers, except
                    they emit microwave radiation rather than visible
                    radiation.)

                    Proving their working hypothesis will be much more
                    challenging, although there have been rare sightings of such
                    naturally occurring masers from hydrogen molecules in space.
                    But nobody has ever spotted an atomic hydrogen cloud with an
                    associated maser, and that's what would be needed to explain
                    the intensity of the Wow! signal. That's why other
                    astronomers are opting for cautious skepticism. “A magnetar
                    is going to produce [short] radio emissions as well. Do you
                    really need this complicated maser stuff happening as well
                    to explain the Wow! signal?” Michael Garrett of the

                    In a new letter, OpenAI chief strategy officer Jason Kwon
                    insists that AI regulations should be left to the federal
                    government. As reported previously by
                    <a
                      href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-21/openai-says-california-s-controversial-ai-bill-will-hurt-innovation"
                      ><em>Bloomberg</em></a
                    >, Kwon says that a new AI safety bill under consideration
                    in California could slow progress and cause companies to
                    leave the state.

                    According to proponents like Wiener, it establishes
                    standards ahead of the development of more powerful AI
                    models, requires precautions like pre-deployment safety
                    testing and other safeguards, adds whistleblower protections
                    for employees of AI labs, gives California’s Attorney
                    General power to take legal action if AI models cause harm,
                    and calls for establishing a “public cloud computer cluster”
                    called CalCompute.

                    published Wednesday evening, Wiener points out that the
                    proposed requirements apply to any company doing business in
                    California, whether they are headquartered in the state or
                    not, so the argument “makes no sense.” He also writes that
                    OpenAI “...doesn’t criticize a single provision of the bill”
                    and closes by saying, “SB 1047 is a highly reasonable bill
                    that asks large AI labs to do what they’ve already committed
                    to doing, namely, test their large models for catastrophic
                    safety risk.”

                    Apple device users recently discovered a minor bug that
                    causes the Settings screen and home screen to crash. While
                    no serious issues have been reported so far, a fix in a
                    future firmware update would not be surprising.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Swiping right on the iOS home screen until the app library
                    appears, and then typing the characters "::" into the search
                    bar, causes Springboard – the software that handles the main
                    menu – to crash. A black screen with a loading icon briefly
                    appears before the device returns to the lock screen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, entering the same characters into the search
                    bar at the top of the Settings menu crashes the app,
                    immediately sending users back to the home screen. However,
                    the bug can be triggered by variations of this character
                    combination as well.
                  </p>

                    that nearly any combination involving two quotation marks,
                    one colon, and any other character can trigger the same
                    effect. For example, typing "X":X also causes the issue.
                    TechSpot confirmed that the bug occurs on iPhones and iPads
                    running firmware version 17.6.1, but Macs remain unaffected.

                    However, the bug may raise some concerns because it
                    resembles more serious incidents from the past.

                    For example, particles ejected at velocities below 500 m/s
                    could reach Mars in about 13 years, whereas those ejected at
                    velocities exceeding 1.5 km/s (5,400 km/h; 3,355 mph) could
                    reach Earth in as little as seven years. However, their
                    simulations indicated that it will likely be up to 30 years
                    before any of this ejecta is observed on Earth.

                Also what is the difference between a programmer and a
                developer? One apparently loves AI while the other one shuns it
                like the plague according to their summary table. It's unclear
                except something about how they self-identify on their business

                If AI improves your code then does that not scare these people?
                After all eventually you'll be cut from the loop, cause you are
                a cost. Perhaps coders in Germany are just better then the
                coders in America and India?

                That appears more and more to be the fantasy that they want to
                sell. For companies they want to get rid of the humans since
                they are costs. If the AI can do their job somewhat equally.
                There doesn't appear to be much in the way of backing up that
                statement in reality.

                It appears to be free up time to upskill (?) your something

                it frees up more time to invent new words and concepts that they

                    this decision because it is essential that every person
                    feels like they can simply take their cell phone out into
                    the world without the fear that they might end up a criminal

                    The new Fifth Circuit case, <em>United States v. Smith</em>,
                    involved an armed robbery and assault of a US Postal Service
                    worker at a post office in Mississippi in 2018. After
                    several months of investigation, police had no identifiable
                    suspects, so they obtained a geofence warrant covering a
                    large geographic area around the post office for the hour
                    surrounding the crime. Google responded to the warrant with
                    information on several devices, ultimately leading police to
                    the two defendants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On appeal, the Fifth Circuit reached several important
                    holdings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, it determined that under the Supreme Court's landmark
                    ruling in <em>Carpenter v. United States</em>, individuals
                    have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the location
                    data implicated by geofence warrants. As a result, the court
                    broke from the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/07/eff-tells-minnesota-supreme-court-strike-down-geofence-warrant-fourth-circuit"
                      >Fourth Circuit's deeply flawed decision last month</a
                    >
                    in <em>United States v. Chatrie</em>, noting that although
                    geofence warrants can be more "limited temporally" than the
                    data sought in <em>Carpenter</em>, geofence location data is
                    still highly invasive because it can expose sensitive
                    information about a person's associations and allow police
                    to "follow" them into private spaces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Second, the court found that even though investigators seek
                    warrants for geofence location data, these searches are
                    inherently unconstitutional. As the court noted, geofence
                    warrants require a provider, almost always Google, to search
                    "the entirety" of its reserve of location data "while law
                    enforcement officials have no idea who they are looking for,
                    or whether the search will even turn up a result."
                    Therefore, "the quintessential problem with these warrants
                    is that they <em>never</em> include a specific user to be
                    identified, only a temporal and geographic location where
                    any given user <em>may</em> turn up post-search. That is
                    constitutionally insufficient."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unsurprisingly, however, the court found that in 2018,
                    police could have relied on such a warrant in "good faith,"
                    because geofence technology was novel, and police reached
                    out to other agencies with more experience for guidance.
                    This means that the evidence they obtained will not be
                    suppressed in this case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nevertheless, it is gratifying to see an appeals court
                    recognize the fundamental invasions of privacy created by
                    these warrants and uphold our constitutional tradition
                    prohibiting general searches. Police around the country have
                    increasingly relied on geofence warrants and other reverse
                    warrants, and this opinion should act as a warning against
                    narrow applications of Fourth Amendment precedent in these
                    cases.

                    Facebook, X, YouTube and other social media platforms rely
                    on a 1996 law to insulate themselves from legal liability
                    for user posts. The protection from this law,
                    <a

                      >Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act</a
                    >, is so significant that it has allowed tech companies to
                    flourish.<br />But what if the same law could be used to
                    rein in the power of those social media giants?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That idea is at the heart of a lawsuit filed in May against
                    Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The
                    plaintiff has asked a federal court to declare that a
                    little-used part of Section 230 makes it permissible for him
                    to release his own software that lets users automatically
                    unfollow everyone on Facebook.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit, filed by Ethan Zuckerman, a public policy
                    professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, is the
                    first to use Section 230 against a tech giant in this way,
                    his lawyers said. It is
                    <a
                      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/technology/section-230-explainer.html"
                      >an unusual</a
                    >
                    legal maneuver that could turn a law that typically protects
                    companies like Meta on its head. And if Mr. Zuckerman
                    succeeds, it could mean more power for consumers to control
                    what they see online.<br />[...]<br />Mr. Zuckerman has
                    focused on a part of Section 230 that spells out protection
                    for blocking objectionable material online. In 2021, after a
                    developer released software to purge users' Facebook feeds
                    of everyone they follow, Facebook threatened to shut it
                    down. But Section 230 says it is possible to restrict access
                    to obscene, excessively violent and other problematic
                    content. The language shields companies from liability if
                    they censor disturbing content, but lawyers now say it could
                    also be used to justify scrubbing any content users don't
                    want to see.

                  <p>
                    Meta said it had asked U.S. District Court for the Northern
                    District of California, where the lawsuit was filed, to
                    dismiss the case because Mr. Zuckerman had not released a
                    software tool to clean up people's Facebook pages. It also
                    argued that Mr. Zuckerman had not shown that Section 230
                    should apply in his case.

                    AP reported yesterday that "Disney drops bid to have
                    allergy-death lawsuit tossed because plaintiff signed up for
                    Disney+."
                  </p>

                    I'm not a lawyer but the initial legal argument being made
                    by Disney seems to me to be pure bad faith horseshit. This
                    piece in New York Magazine looks at the lawsuit stemming
                    from the allergic reaction death of a doctor named Amy
                    Tangsuan at a Disney World Resort restaurant:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        Tangsuan was allergic to dairy and nuts, and before she
                        and her husband ordered, (they) asked a waiter whether
                        any of the allergens were in her order... The waiter
                        consulted with the chef, and then assured her that they
                        could be made dairy- and nut-free.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        About 45 minutes after Tangsuan ate, she went into an
                        anaphylactic shock so severe her EpiPen was useless. She
                        died soon after at a nearby hospital. In February, her
                        husband filed a wrongful-death suit against the
                        restaurant and Disney's theme-parks division, seeking
                        money damages.
                      </p>
                    </div>

                  <p>
                    [...] Did they try this now abandoned tactic to save money?
                    Of course. But it sounds like they're really doing it to
                    save face — by moving cases to arbitration, it's permanently
                    out of the public's view; however the case is settled, the
                    general public will almost certainly be in the dark. PR
                    problem of killing guests thus solved.

                So they will not try that again until next time that they do ...

                    NASA now plans to conduct two reviews – a Program Control

                    deciding how it will safely return Wilmore and Williams from

                    the International Space Station with astronauts. The flight
                    test aims to prove the system is ready for rotational
                    missions to the space station. NASA wants two American
                    spacecraft, in addition to the Roscosmos Soyuz spacecraft,
                    capable of carrying astronauts to help ensure a permanent
                    crew aboard the orbiting complex.

                    This flight test aims to demonstrate Starliner’s ability to
                    execute a six-month rotational mission to the space station.
                    The flight test objectives were developed to support NASA’s
                    certification process and gather the performance data needed
                    to evaluate readiness ahead of long-duration flights.

                    During Starliner’s flight to the space station, some of the
                    spacecraft’s thrusters did not perform as expected and
                    several leaks in Starliner’s helium system were observed.
                    While the initial mission duration was planned for about a
                    week, there is no rush to bring crew home, so NASA and
                    Boeing are taking additional time to learn about the
                    spacecraft. This is a lesson learned from the space shuttle
                    Columbia accident. Our NASA and Boeing teams are poring over
                    data from additional in-space and ground testing and
                    analysis, providing mission managers data to make the best,
                    safest decision on how and when to return crew home.

                  <p>
                    Starliner remains the primary option for Butch and Suni if
                    an emergency occurs and they need to rapidly depart the
                    station. There is no urgent need to bring them home, and
                    NASA is using the extra time to understand the spacecraft’s
                    technical issues before deciding on a return plan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If NASA decides to return Starliner uncrewed, Butch and Suni
                    would remain aboard station until late-February 2025. NASA
                    would replan the agency’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission by launching
                    only two crew members instead of four in late September.
                    Butch and Suni would then return to Earth after the
                    regularly scheduled Crew-9 increment early next year.

                  <p>
                    No decisions have been made. NASA continues to evaluate all
                    options as it learns more about Starliner’s propulsion
                    system. Butch and Suni may return home aboard Starliner, or
                    they could come back as part of the agency’s SpaceX Crew-9
                    mission early next year.

                  <p>
                    Yes, Starliner can undock and deorbit autonomously, if NASA
                    decides to return the spacecraft uncrewed.

                  <p>
                    If NASA decides to return them aboard a SpaceX Dragon, NASA
                    will replan its SpaceX Crew-9 mission by launching only two
                    crew members in late September instead of four. Butch and
                    Suni would then return to Earth after the regularly

                    The main goal of the agency’s Commercial Crew Program is
                    two, unique human spaceflight systems. Should any one system
                    encounter an issue, NASA still has the capability to launch
                    and return crew to ensure safety and a continuous human
                    presence aboard the International Space Station.

                  <p>
                    No, Butch and Suni are safe aboard the space station working
                    alongside the Expedition 71 crew. They also have been
                    actively involved in Starliner testing and technical
                    meetings. Butch and Suni could return home aboard Starliner
                    if an emergency arises. The agency also has other return
                    options available, if needed, for both contingency and
                    normal returning planning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Butch and Suni each have previously completed two
                    long-duration stays aboard the station. NASA astronauts
                    embark on missions fully aware of the various scenarios that
                    may become reality. This mission is no different, and they
                    understood the possibilities and unknowns of this test
                    flight, including being aboard station longer than planned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A typical stay aboard the International Space Station is
                    about six months, and NASA astronauts also have remained on
                    the space station for

                  <p>
                    Yes. The International Space Station is well-stocked with
                    everything the crew needs, including food, water, clothing,
                    and oxygen. Additionally, NASA and its space station
                    partners frequently launch resupply missions to the orbiting
                    complex carrying additional supplies and cargo.

                    The crew continues to monitor Starliner’s flight systems and
                    gather performance data for system certification. NASA also
                    is taking advantage of Butch and Suni’s extra time aboard
                    the orbital laboratory, where they have completed various
                    science experiments, maintenance tasks, and assisted with

                    Butch and Suni enjoy many of the same comforts we have here
                    on Earth. They can email, call, and video conference with
                    their family and friends when they have “free time” aboard
                    the International Space Station.

                    NASA has two unique American space transportation systems
                    capable of carrying crew to and from station. Although no
                    decisions have been made, NASA is considering several
                    options to return Butch and Suni from the space station,
                    including returning aboard Starliner, if cleared, or as part
                    of the agency’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission in February 2025.

                    Crewed test flights are inherently risky, and although
                    rotation missions may seem routine, they also are not
                    without risk. It is NASA’s job to evaluate that risk and
                    determine whether it is acceptable for the crew ahead of
                    each flight.

                    Microsoft's Patch Tuesday for August 2024 includes a fix for
                    a security vulnerability in the Grub2 boot loader, which is
                    used by many Linux operating systems. Tracked as
                    <a

                    protection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Grub2 boot loader provides compatibility with the Secure
                    Boot technology on PCs running Linux systems. After
                    installing the new patch, Windows applies a Secure Boot
                    Advanced Targeting (SBAT) policy to block vulnerable Linux
                    boot loaders that could compromise OS security.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft explained that the SBAT value would not be applied
                    to dual-boot systems with both Windows and Linux on the boot
                    drive, so the patch was expected not to impact these
                    systems. However, many users with dual-boot configurations
                    have reported that the CVE-2022-2601 update still rendered
                    booting into a Linux OS impossible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The issue appears to affect various Linux distributions,
                    including popular ones such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Zorin OS,
                    Puppy Linux, and others. Affected systems typically display
                    a "Security Policy Violation" error at boot, indicating a
                    failed check on "shim SBAT data." Boot problems have been
                    reported on both dual-boot systems and on Windows devices
                    running Linux from an
                    <a href="https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/issues/2947"
                      >ISO image</a
                    >, USB drive, or optical media.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft's bulletin noted that only older Linux distros'
                    ISOs were expected to experience boot issues following the
                    CVE-2022-2601 patch. However, users with systems released in
                    2024 also seem to be affected. The only reliable way to
                    restore a bootable state appears to be disabling Secure Boot
                    entirely. Alternatively, users can

                    controversy. The company didn't elaborate further on
                    specific changes it's making to Recall beyond what it
                    already announced in June.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For those unfamiliar, Recall is a Windows service that runs
                    in the background on compatible PCs, continuously taking
                    screenshots of user activity, scanning those screenshots
                    with optical character recognition (OCR), and saving the OCR
                    text and the screenshots to a giant searchable database on
                    your PC. The goal, according to Microsoft, is to help users
                    retrace their steps and dig up information about things they
                    had used their PCs to find or do in the past.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem was that other users on the same PC, or
                    attackers with physical or remote access to your PC, could
                    easily access, view, and export those screenshots and the
                    OCR database since none of the information was encrypted at
                    rest or protected in any substantive way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft had planned to launch Recall as one of the
                    flagship features of its Copilot+ PC launch in July, along
                    with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered Surface devices,
                    but its rollout was bumped back and then paused entirely so
                    that Recall could be reworked and then sent out to Windows
                    Insiders for testing like most other Windows features are.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among the changes Microsoft has said it will make: The
                    database will be encrypted at rest and will require
                    authentication (and periodic reauthentication) with Windows
                    Hello before users will be allowed to access it. The feature
                    will also be off by default, whereas the original plan was
                    to turn it on by default and make users go into Settings to
                    turn it off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Security continues to be our top priority and when Recall
                    is available for Windows Insiders in October we will publish
                    a blog with more details," reads today's update to Microsoft
                    Windows and Devices Corporate Vice President Pavan
                    Davuluri's blog post.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the preview is released, Windows Insiders who want to
                    test the Recall preview will need to do it on a PC that
                    meets Microsoft's Copilot+ system requirements. Those
                    include a processor with a neural processing unit (NPU)
                    capable of at least 40 trillion operations per second
                    (TOPS), 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. The x86 builds of
                    Windows for Intel and AMD processors don't currently support
                    any Copilot+ features regardless of whether the PC meets
                    those requirements, but that should change later this year.

                    Chen says that similar reactors have been tested before, but
                    the electrodes could not shuffle charges at a sufficient
                    voltage for the reaction to work – unless

                    were added to the wastewater. He and his colleagues made
                    their device more practical by filling its middle chamber
                    with a porous material that plays the role of those salts,
                    so wastewater can be fed directly into the reactor without
                    additives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In experiments with water samples that had realistic
                    concentrations of nitrates, the reactor processed 100
                    millilitres in about an hour, and it kept working well when
                    it ran for 10 days straight. Its performance is similar to
                    that of previous, more complicated reactor designs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team has only tested the reactor in the lab using
                    nitrate-rich water, not real wastewater samples, which
                    contain more than just nitrates, says Chen. But the
                    researchers eventually envision local businesses and farms
                    using these reactors to recycle wastewater, instead of
                    sending it to far-away treatment plants that waste its
                    ammonia-making potential.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the best-case scenario, a farm might have its own
                    reactor, powered by solar or wind power. Farmers could run
                    local wastewater through the device and immediately

                    in March that it would be reviewing 21 chemicals found in

                    An example of the 21 food additives to be reviewed is
                    potassium bromate, a chemical added to baked goods and

                    “This is a stark example of the FDA’s regulatory gap,” said
                    Pomeranz. “We’re seeing states starting to act to fill the
                    regulatory void left by the FDA’s inaction over substances
                    increasingly associated with harm.”

                    The FDA’s oversight of GRAS ingredients on the market is
                    also limited. The agency rarely revokes GRAS designation (<a

                    only shows 15 substances that were considered GRAS and then
                    later determined to not be), nor does the FDA review foods
                    on an ongoing basis with GRAS ingredients that can be safe
                    when added at low levels but not in large quantities—for
                    instance, caffeine, salt, and sugar.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “In 1977, the FDA approved caffeine as a GRAS substance for
                    use in sodas at a low level: 0.02 percent,” said Pomeranz.
                    “But today, caffeine is added to energy drinks at levels far
                    exceeding this, which is causing caffeine-related
                    hospitalizations and even deaths. Given that the FDA
                    regulates the use of GRAS substances, the agency could set
                    limits on the amount of caffeine in energy drinks.”

                    find more opportunities for efficiency, a GM spokesperson
                    told the DCNF [Daily Caller News Foundataion]. Monday's job
                    cuts followed a decision by the two new GM executives from
                    Apple, Baris Cetinok and Dave Richardson, to streamline the
                    service and software business, sources familiar with the

                    would be affected at the company's global technical center
                    in Warren, Michigan.

                    Earlier this year, several authors sued NVIDIA over alleged
                    copyright infringement. The class action lawsuit alleged
                    that the company's AI models were trained on copyrighted
                    works and specifically mentioned Books3 data. Since this
                    happened without permission, the rightsholders demand
                    compensation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit was followed up by a near-identical case a few
                    weeks later, and NVIDIA plans to challenge both in court by
                    denying the copyright infringement allegations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In its initial response, filed a few weeks ago, NVIDIA did
                    not deny that it used the Books3 dataset. Like many other AI
                    companies, it believes that the use of copyrighted data for
                    AI training is a prime example of fair use; especially when
                    the output of the model doesn't reproduce copyrighted works.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The authors clearly have a different take. They allege that
                    NVIDIA willingly copied an archive of pirated books to train
                    its commercial AI model, and are demanding damages for
                    direct copyright infringement.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    [...] NVIDIA also shared its early outlook on the case. The
                    company believes that AI companies should be allowed to use
                    copyrighted books to train their AI models, as these books
                    are made up of "uncopyrightable facts and ideas" that are
                    already in the public domain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The argument may seem surprising at first; the authors own
                    copyrights and as far they're concerned, use of pirated
                    copies leads to liability as a direct infringer. However,
                    NVIDIA goes on to explain that their AI models don't see
                    these works that way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AI training doesn't involve any book reading skills, or even
                    a basic understanding of a storyline. Instead, it simply
                    measures statistical correlations and adds these to the
                    model.

                    Tennessee, have also been studying Victorian books from that
                    university's library collection in order to identify and
                    quantify levels of poisonous substances in the covers. They

                    Winterthur Museum, Garden, and Library. The initial
                    objective was to analyze all the Victorian-era books in the
                    Winterthur circulating and rare books collection for the
                    presence of an arsenic compound called cooper acetoarsenite,
                    an emerald green pigment that was very popular at the time
                    to dye wallpaper, clothing, and cloth book covers. Book

                    The Poison Book Project is ongoing, but 50 percent of the
                    19th century cloth-case bindings tested so far contain lead
                    in the cloth across a range of colors, as well as other
                    highly toxic heavy metals: arsenic, chromium, and mercury.

                    one's fingernails or touching one's face during handling, as
                    well as washing hands thoroughly and wiping down surfaces.
                    Arsenical green books should be isolated for storage and
                    removed from circulating collections, if possible. And
                    professional conservators should work under a chemical fume
                    hood to limit their exposure to arsenical pigment dust.

                An interesting article about why legalese is written the way it
                is:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    A new study shows lawyers find simplified legal documents
                    easier to understand, more appealing, and just as
                    enforceable as traditional contracts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's no secret that legal documents are notoriously
                    difficult to understand, causing headaches for anyone who
                    has had to apply for a mortgage or review any other kind of
                    contract. A new MIT study reveals that the lawyers who
                    produce these documents don't like them very much either.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers found that while lawyers can interpret and
                    recall information from legal documents better than
                    nonlawyers, it's still easier for them to understand the
                    same documents when translated into "plain English." Lawyers
                    also rated plain English contracts as higher-quality
                    overall, more likely to be signed by a client, and equally
                    enforceable as those written in "legalese."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The findings suggest that while impenetrable styles of legal
                    writing are well-entrenched, lawyers may be amenable to
                    changing the way such documents are written.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "No matter how we asked the questions, the lawyers
                    overwhelmingly always wanted plain English," says Edward
                    Gibson, an MIT professor of brain and cognitive sciences and
                    the senior author of the study. "People blame lawyers, but I
                    don't think it's their fault. They would like to change it,
                    too."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eric Martínez, an MIT graduate student and licensed
                    attorney, is the lead author of the new study, which appears
                    this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
                    Sciences. Frank Mollica, a former visiting researcher at MIT
                    who is now a lecturer in computational cognitive science at
                    the University of Edinburgh, is also an author of the

                    [...] As Chicken Soup sorts through its debts and
                    liquidation, customers are left without guidance about what
                    to do with their rental DVDs or how they can access
                    movies/shows they purchased. But when it comes to purchases
                    made via streaming services, it's more accurate to consider
                    them rentals, despite them not being labeled as such and
                    costing more than rentals with set time limits. As we've
                    seen before, streaming companies can quickly yank away
                    content that people feel that they paid to own, be it due to

                    [...] The researchers said the findings, published in the
                    journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science, suggests horses
                    have the ability to form an internal model of the world
                    around them to make decisions and predictions, a technique
                    known as model-based learning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It was previously thought that model-based learning was too
                    complex for horses because they have an underdeveloped
                    pre-frontal cortex, a part of the brain associated with
                    strategic thinking.

                  <p>
                    Dr Ijichi said this suggests that the hoses "must be using
                    another area of the brain to achieve a similar result".

                    She said: "This teaches us that we shouldn't make

                    whether they are 'built' just like us."

                      >PCWorld</a
                    >, Chrome's shift from Manifest V2 to V3 is deprecating
                    certain features that the popular ad-blocker relies on. The
                    Chrome update "aims to... improve the privacy, security, and
                    performance of extensions," by changing the way it manages
                    API requests. That means with the upcoming Chrome update,
                    uBlock Origin will be automatically disabled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The popular ad-blocker, which has over 30 million
                    users, reportedly still works. But a disclaimer at the top
                    of extension page says, "This extension may soon no longer
                    be supported because it doesn't follow best practices for
                    Chrome extensions."

                    Developer Raymond Hill who makes uBlock Origin has scrambled
                    to deploy a fix and now offers

                      >uBlock Origin Lite</a
                    >, which is compliant with Manifest V3. It already has
                    200,000 users, and still has standard ad-blocking
                    capabilities, but is less dynamic in the sense that it
                    requires the user to allow or block permissions on a
                    "per-site basis." In a GitHub
                    <a
                      href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions-(FAQ)"
                      >post</a
                    >
                    about the new extension, Hill explained that it isn't
                    intended to be a replacement for the original.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I consider uBO Lite to be too different from uBO to be an
                    automatic replacement," said the developer. "You will have
                    to explicitly find a replacement to uBO according to what
                    you expect from a content blocker. uBO Lite may or may not
                    fulfill your expectations."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    uBlock Origin still works on other browsers, so you could
                    always switch to a Chrome alternative like Firefox or Edge.
                    But if you want to stick with Chrome, you have to play by
                    Chrome's rules, and that means getting a different
                    ad-blocker.

                    Typically, the ratio between high alcohol groups and lager
                    ester amounts ranges between 3-4:1, with higher ratios
                    offering a drier, less aromatic beer. The team recorded
                    their control samples as having a ratio of 1.4:1, while
                    their microgravity beer measured 4.6:1, implying the latter
                    was "less aromatic by this measure." Meanwhile, two esters
                    in particular, isoamyl acetate and 2-phenethyl acetate,
                    showed "significant differences" between microgravity and
                    controls. Higher concentrations of these esters produce a
                    fruity, banana-like flavor in beers that many drinkers often
                    consider undesirable. In the microgravity brews, a
                    "multiple-fold decrease" in ester concentration compared to
                    the standard examples.

                    "Depending upon the brewery, these compounds may be
                    desirable; however, the presence of these compounds above a
                    detection threshold would usually be considered a defect,"
                    the team writes. Given this, their microgravity results
                    offered a final product "that would be considered higher
                    quality due to the reduced esters.

                    Brooke Russell, formerly a Chamberlain Postdoctoral Fellow
                    at Berkeley Lab and now the Neil and Jane Pappalardo Special
                    Fellow in Physics at MIT, played a crucial role in the
                    development of the 2×2 prototype, which she describes as "a
                    first-of-its-kind detector, with more than 337,000
                    individual charge-sensitive pixels at roughly 4-millimeter
                    granularity." Berkeley Lab led the design, construction, and
                    testing of the end-to-end pixelated charge readout system
                    during the COVID-19 pandemic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Operation of the 2×2 prototype in a neutrino beam will
                    usher in a new era of high-fidelity, inherently 3D LArTPC
                    images for neutrino interaction measurements," Russell said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The final version of the DUNE near detector will feature 35
                    liquid argon modules, each larger than those in the
                    prototype. The modules will help navigate the enormous flux
                    of neutrinos expected at the near site.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 2×2 prototype implements novel technologies that enable
                    a new regime of detailed, cutting-edge neutrino imaging to
                    handle the unique conditions in DUNE. It has a
                    millimeter-sized pixel readout system, developed by a team
                    at Berkeley Lab, that allows for high-precision 3D imaging
                    on a large scale. This, coupled with its modular design,
                    sets the prototype apart from previous neutrino detectors
                    like ICARUS and MicroBooNE.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, the 2×2 prototype provides the first
                    accelerator-neutrino data to be analyzed and published by
                    the DUNE collaboration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    DUNE is split between two locations hundreds of miles apart:
                    A beam of neutrinos originating at Fermilab, close to
                    Chicago, will pass through a particle detector located on
                    the Fermilab site, then travel 800 miles through the ground
                    to several huge detectors at the Sanford Underground
                    Research Facility (SURF) in South Dakota.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The DUNE detector at Fermilab will analyze the neutrino beam
                    close to its origin, where the beam is extremely intense.
                    Collaborators expect this near detector to record about 50
                    interactions per pulse, which will come every second,
                    amounting to hundreds of millions of neutrino detections
                    over DUNE's many expected years of operation. Scientists
                    will also use DUNE to study neutrinos' antimatter
                    counterpart, antineutrinos.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This unprecedented flux of accelerator-made neutrinos and
                    antineutrinos will enable DUNE's ambitious science goals.
                    Physicists will study the particles with DUNE's near and far
                    detectors to learn more about how they change type as they
                    travel, a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation. By
                    looking for differences between neutrino oscillations and
                    antineutrino oscillations, physicists will seek evidence for
                    a broken symmetry known as CP violation to determine whether
                    neutrinos might be responsible for the prevalence of matter
                    in our universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The DUNE collaboration is made up of more than 1,400
                    scientists and engineers from over 200 research
                    institutions. Nearly 40 of these institutions work on the
                    near detector. Specifically, the hardware development of the
                    2×2 prototype was led by the University of Bern in
                    Switzerland, DOE's Fermilab, Berkeley Lab, and SLAC National
                    Accelerator Laboratory, with significant contributions from
                    many universities.

                    There's many legends in computer history. But a legend is
                    nothing but a story. Someone tells it, someone else
                    remembers it, and everybody passes it on. And the Apple IIGS
                    has a legend all its own. Here, in Userlandia, we're going
                    to bust some megahertz myths.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I love the Apple IIGS. It's the fabulous home computer you'd
                    have to be crazy to hate. One look at its spec sheet will
                    tell you why. The Ensoniq synthesizer chip brings 32 voices
                    of polyphonic power to the desktop. Apple's Video Graphics
                    Controller paints beautiful on-screen pictures from a
                    palette of thousands of colors. Seven slots and seven ports
                    provide plenty of potential for powerful peripherals. These
                    ingredients make a great recipe for a succulent home
                    computer. But you can't forget the most central ingredient:
                    the central processing unit. It's a GTE 65SC816 clocked at
                    2.8 MHz—about 2.72 times faster than an Apple IIe. When the
                    IIGS launched in September 1986 its contemporaries were
                    systems like the Atari 1040ST, the Commodore Amiga 1000, and
                    of course Apple's own Macintosh Plus. These machines all
                    sported a Motorola 68000 clocked between 7 and 8 MHz. If I
                    know anything about which number is bigger than the other
                    number, I'd say that Motorola's CPU is faster.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Now hold on there," you say! "Megahertz is just the clock
                    speed of the chip—it says nothing about how many
                    instructions are actually executed during those cycles, let
                    alone the time spent reading and writing to RAM!" And you
                    know what, that's true! The Apple II and Commodore 64 with
                    their 6502 and 6510 CPUs clocked at 1 MHz could trade blows
                    with Z80 powered computers running at three times the clock
                    speed. And the IIGS had the 6502's 16-bit descendant: the
                    65C816. Steve Wozniak thought Western Design Center had
                    something special with that chip.

                    diminished ad revenue.) <em>Bloomberg</em>

                    their published content to produce

                  <p>
                    The crux of the problem lies in the Googlebot, the crawler
                    that scours and indexes the live web to produce the results
                    you see when you enter search terms. If publishers block
                    Google from using their content for the AI-produced answers
                    you now see littered at the top of many search results, they
                    also lose the privilege of including their web pages in the
                    standard web results.

                    or Android). Other options it's reportedly weighing include
                    forcing Google to share search data with competitors or
                    relinquishing its default search-engine deals, like the

                    standard searches, leaving web publishers with little (if
                    any) leverage. If you let Google scrape your content for AI
                    Overview answers, readers may consider that the end of the
                    matter without bothering to visit your site (meaning zero
                    revenue from those potential readers). But if you block the
                    Googlebot, you lose search visibility, which likely means
                    significantly less short-term income and a colossal loss of
                    long-term competitive standing.

                    Crucially, said Fischer-Gödde, the result is different to
                    the composition generally found on Earth, ruling out a
                    theory that the presence of ruthenium and other metals such
                    as osmium and platinum, are down to past eruptions of the
                    Deccan Traps volcanoes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team also cast doubt on the possibility that the
                    impactor was a comet, saying the ruthenium isotope
                    composition of the samples is different to that of
                    meteorites thought to be fragments of comets that have lost
                    their ice.

                    [...] Fischer-Gödde said C-type asteroids can today be found
                    in the asteroid belt that sits between Mars and Jupiter
                    because, not long after the formation of the solar system,
                    Jupiter migrated, scattering asteroids in the process.

                  <p>
                    As a result, he suggests the ill-fated space rock probably
                    came from there.

                    "Maybe there was a collision of two asteroid bodies in the
                    belt, and then this chunk kind of went on an Earth-crossing
                    orbit. That could be one scenario," he said, although he
                    noted there are other possibilities, including that it came
                    from the Oort cloud that is thought to surround the solar
                    system.

                    In 1983, the home video game console market crashed bringing
                    many companies to fold. After the dust settled, Nintendo
                    emerged as a phoenix from the flames with their iconic
                    Famicom, known outside of Japan as the Nintendo
                    Entertainment System (NES). The NES went on to sell in
                    excess of 60 million units and brought about the third
                    generation of console gaming. The success in 2016 of the NES
                    Classic goes to show how popular the console and its games
                    still are. While it may not have been obvious at the time,
                    understanding the scope of IP rights may have helped to make
                    this possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For the aspiring home console manufacturer in the early
                    1980s, there were really only two options when considering
                    what microprocessor to use. The first option was the Zilog
                    Z80, most notably used by the ColecoVision and the Sega
                    Master System. The second option was the MOS Technology
                    6502, which was being used by the Atari 2600 (in the
                    stripped-down form of the 6507), the Commodore 64, and
                    numerous arcade games. When Masayuki Uemura, then head of
                    Nintendo's R+D2 team, was presented with these options
                    whilst developing the Famicom, he opted for the 6502.
                    Although an official justification for this choice has never
                    been given, a cursory glance at the patents for the two
                    chips reveals that the decision may have been driven, at
                    least in part, by patent protection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the NES finally hit US shores in October of 1985, very
                    little was known about the technical specification of the
                    console. All that was known was that the NES was powered by
                    a hitherto unknown processor called the Ricoh 2A03. The most
                    notable thing about the 2A03 was that its instruction set
                    was almost identical to the 6502. Put another way, if you
                    could program for the 6502, you could program for the 2A03.
                    But the 2A03 wasn't a 6502, if it was then Nintendo would
                    have had to get some kind of agreement from MOS Technology
                    in order to use it. No such agreement was in place.

                    goal of exploring the integration of perception and control
                    mechanisms in autonomous vehicles.<br />[...]<br />The
                    company's L4 test vehicles are designed to handle most
                    driving tasks independently, without the need for driver
                    intervention. Equipped with an array of sensors and
                    redundant systems for enhanced safety, the company says
                    these vehicles are capable of executing maneuvers in busy
                    urban environments, such as parking, making U-turns,
                    navigating traffic circles and performing unprotected left
                    turns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On expressways, the vehicles can autonomously change lanes
                    when the vehicle ahead slows down and can pass through toll
                    stations. In extreme situations, the vehicles are programmed
                    to follow a minimal risk strategy, safely stopping in a
                    secure location, according to Mercedes.

                Kudos to Mercedes for jumping from Level 2 directly to L4. L3
                requires that the driver stay alert and be prepared to take
                control at any time...something that humans are notoriously bad
                at doing.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of my first reactions when I read the SAE scheme (years ago)
                was: while L3 is a logical development step (in terms of
                incremental technology improvements), in the real world it
                should never be allowed on public roads.

                    In the realm of messaging apps and services, it's pretty
                    easy to get lost in a sea of the same. Just about every
                    service claims to be the most secure, the most
                    user-friendly, and the most private. But are they… really?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team behind a new messaging app/service reached out to
                    me to introduce their product called <a
                      href="https://getsession.org/"
                      >Session</a
                    >. According to the Session site, "Session is an end-to-end
                    encrypted messenger that minimizes sensitive metadata,
                    designed and built for people who want absolute privacy and
                    freedom from any form of surveillance."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of course, I was skeptical, but when I installed the app and
                    set it up, I realized I was dealing with something
                    different. With Session, there's no phone number, account
                    name, or footprint to be had. Session uses an onion routing
                    network to ensure you leave no trace, so it's simply
                    impossible for anyone to create a profile based on metadata
                    or account information. All accounts are completely
                    anonymous, and zero data is collected, which means there's
                    absolutely nothing to leak.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When you install the app, you create an account; the
                    only thing associated with that account is the Account ID.
                    Copy that ID and share it with anyone you'd like to chat
                    with and get to the communication, knowing everything is
                    secured with end-to-end encryption, and none of your
                    personal information is shared or saved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] During account creation, you do have to enter a
                    display name, but you're not required to use your real name.
                    You can also choose between fast and slow notification
                    modes. The fast mode uses Google's notification servers, and
                    the slow mode means Session will occasionally check for new
                    messages in the background. Session recommends using the
                    fast mode, but if I had to guess, I would assume the slow
                    mode to be the most private.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Session is still in its infancy, and few people know
                    about this app/service. For anyone trying to escape the
                    usual concerns that their information will be leaked, you
                    can trust that this is less likely to happen with Session
                    than with many other options. Even if your information was
                    leaked, the only thing hackers could get would be your
                    Account ID, as there's no other information tied to your
                    account. And with all communication secured with E2E, even
                    your chats would be hard to view.

                    "loosely time-based release process," with a new major
                    kernel release occurring every two to three months. The
                    actual release date for each new version is described as
                    "fluid," meaning that project leader Linus Torvalds may
                    adjust the upstream development process if a significant bug
                    is discovered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A stable release cadence is crucial for maintaining a
                    reliable operating system, explains Canonical's Brett
                    Grandbois. Ubuntu isn't just your weird uncle's experimental
                    Linux OS used by hobbyists; it is officially available in
                    multiple editions, including desktop environments, servers,
                    cloud data centers, and IoT devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "To provide users with the absolute latest in features
                    and hardware support, Ubuntu will now ship the latest
                    available version of the upstream Linux kernel at the
                    specified Ubuntu release freeze date," Canonical stated,
                    even if that kernel is still in Release Candidate (RC)
                    status and some bugs remain to be resolved before the final
                    release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This new "aggressive kernel version commitment policy"
                    carries risks, as RC releases are not considered final by
                    Torvalds and his team for a reason. However, Canonical will
                    need to manage these risks by providing official support for
                    the specific Linux release included in the new Ubuntu
                    version. Updating the kernel after the release is done isn't
                    feasible either, as the Linux edition shipped with Ubuntu is
                    a largely optimized kernel with specific features, patches
                    and hardware support provided by Canonical and its OEM
                    partners.

                    Scientists in Germany have identified a type of fungi that
                    is capable of breaking down synthetic plastics, offering a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A team at the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and
                    Inland Fisheries in Berlin found that certain microfungi can
                    survive exclusively on plastics, degrading them into simpler
                    forms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While this is a promising breakthrough, especially when it
                    comes to tackling oceanic plastic pollution, experts
                    cautioned that it is not a silver bullet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers observed that microfungi in Lake Stechlin in
                    northeastern Germany can thrive on synthetic polymers
                    without any other carbon source.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The most surprising finding of our work is that our fungi
                    could exclusively grow on some of the synthetic polymers and
                    even form biomass," Hans-Peter Grossart, the lead
                    researcher, told Reuters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Researchers said the fungi's ability to break down
                    plastic may have evolved in response to the overwhelming
                    presence of the synthetic material in their environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These fungi are particularly effective at breaking down
                    polyurethane, a common material used in construction foam,
                    among other products.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While the discovery of plastic-eating fungi is a step
                    forward, it is unlikely to solve the plastic pollution
                    problem on its own.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Experts said the most effective way to tackle plastic
                    pollution is to reduce the amount of material entering the
                    environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Care must be taken with potential solutions of this
                    sort, which could give the impression that we should worry
                    less about plastic pollution because any plastic leaking
                    into the environment will quickly, and ideally safely,
                    degrade. Yet, for the vast majority of plastics, this is not
                    the case," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The global production of plastic has skyrocketed from
                    1.7 million tonnes in 1950 to 400 million tonnes in 2022,
                    according to Statista. And despite increased efforts, only
                    nine per cent of plastic waste is recycled worldwide,
                    reports the UN.

                    Jamming wireless shifters with that toolkit would be
                    considerably easier than even replay attacks, the
                    researchers say. While a jamming attack could prevent a
                    specific rider from shifting gears if a hacker were able to
                    first pick up one of their wireless shifting signals, a
                    saboteur could also simply broadcast a jamming signal at the
                    frequency used by all Shimano shifters, potentially
                    disrupting a large group of racers. The researchers even say
                    that it would be possible to read the shifting signals from
                    an entire peloton of cyclists and then jam everyone
                    <em>except</em> a chosen rider. "You can basically jam
                    everyone except you," says Northeastern professor Aanjhan
                    Ranganathan, another author of the paper.

                    [...] Exactly how the patch will be deployed to customers
                    isn't quite clear either. The company writes that "riders
                    can perform a firmware update on the rear derailleur" using
                    Shimano's E-TUBE Cyclist smartphone app. But it fails to
                    mention whether the fix will apply to the front derailleur.
                    "More information about this process and steps riders can
                    take to update their Di2 systems will be available shortly,"
                    it concludes.

                    [...] In the ruthless world of competitive cycling, which
                    has been rocked to its foundations in recent decades by
                    doping scandals, they argue that rivals hacking each others'
                    shifters is not at all a far-fetched scenario. "This is, in
                    our opinion, a different kind of doping," says Fernandes.
                    "It leaves no trace, and it allows you to cheat in the
                    sport."

                    More broadly, they argue that their radio-based bike hacking

                    Ranganathan, who has also developed solutions for replay
                    attacks on cars' keyless entry systems. "When manufacturers
                    start putting in wireless features in their products, it has

                    Monday that it's shutting down all AdSense accounts in
                    Russia due to "ongoing developments in Russia."

                    This effectively ends Russian content creators' ability to
                    monetize their posts, including YouTube videos. The change
                    impacts accounts monetizing content through AdSense, AdMob,
                    and Ad Manager, the support page said.

                    While Google has declined requests to provide details on
                    what prompted the change, it's the latest escalation of
                    Google's ongoing battle with Russian officials working to
                    control the narrative on Russia's war with Ukraine.

                    in Russia, then temporarily paused all ads in the country
                    the very next month. That March, Google paused the creation
                    of new Russia-based AdSense accounts and blocked ads
                    globally that originated from Russia. In March 2022, Google
                    also paused monetization of any content exploiting,
                    condoning, or dismissing Russia's war with Ukraine.
                    Seemingly as retaliation, Russia seized Google's bank
                    account, causing Google Russia to

                    Since then, Google has "blocked more than 1,000 YouTube

                    million videos," Reuters

                    For Russian creators who have still found ways to monetize
                    their content amid the chaos, Google's decision to abruptly
                    shut down AdSense accounts comes as "a serious blow to their

                    this month, according to a message from Google to users
                    reviewed by Reuters.

                    Google's spokesperson offered little clarification to
                    Reuters and Bleeping Computer, saying only that "we will no
                    longer be able to make payments to Russia-based AdSense
                    accounts that have been able to continue monetizing traffic
                    outside of Russia. As a result, we will be deactivating
                    these accounts effective August 2024."

                    It seems likely, though, that Russia passing a law in
                    March—banning advertising on websites, blogs, social
                    networks, or any other online sources published by a
                    "foreign agent," as Reuters

                    in February—perhaps influenced Google's update. The law also
                    prohibited foreign agents from placing ads on sites, and
                    under the law, foreign agents could include anti-Kremlin
                    politicians, activists, and media. With new authority,
                    Russia may have further retaliated against Google,
                    potentially forcing Google to give up the last bit of
                    monetization available to Russia-based creators increasingly
                    censored online.

                    State assembly member and Putin ally Vyacheslav Volodin said
                    that the law was needed to stop financing "scoundrels"
                    allegedly "killing our soldiers, officers, and civilians,"
                    Reuters reported.

                  <p>
                    [...] As Google has tried to resist pressure from Russian
                    lawmakers to censor content that officials deem illegal,
                    such as content supporting Ukraine or condemning Russia,
                    YouTube had become one of the last bastions of online free
                    speech, Reuters reported. It's unclear how ending
                    monetization in the region will impact access to
                    anti-Kremlin reporting on YouTube or more broadly online in
                    Russia. Last February, a popular journalist with 1.64
                    million subscribers on YouTube, Katerina Gordeeva, wrote on
                    Telegram that "she was suspending her work due to the law,"
                    Reuters reported.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We will no longer be able to work as before," Gordeeva
                    said. "Of course, we will look for a way out."

                    In 2002, after a Pentagon news briefing, the then US
                    secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld was
                    <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3254852.stm"
                      >widely ridiculed</a

                    for his thoughts about knowledge. Discussing the issue of
                    whether Iraq was supplying weapons of mass destruction to
                    terrorists, he said:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know
                    we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to
                    say, we know there are some things we do not know. But there
                    are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don't know we don't
                    know.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rumsfeld was describing a world characterised by
                    uncertainty, insecurity and ambiguity. And he actually made
                    a valid point about how leaders face situations where
                    complete knowledge is not, and cannot be, available.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This awareness of a lack of knowledge is something we call a
                    state of "unknowingness". And
                    <a
                      href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00187267231218630"
                      >our research suggests</a
                    >
                    , perhaps surprisingly, that it can be a good thing for
                    leaders and the organisations they run.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] We also found that if "unknowingness" is recognised
                    and accepted, it can lead to better decision making across
                    an organisation – and improved leadership overall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But any organisation which has to deal with "unknowns"
                    (whether they are known or unknown) would benefit from
                    recognising and accepting these particular challenges.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There may be little they can do about the things they don't
                    even know they don't know about yet. But when they are aware
                    of the absence of knowledge, and accept an inability to know
                    everything or always make the "right" decision,

                    <em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em>, the scientists
                    describe using a large language model—an AI tool like the
                    one that powers ChatGPT—to engineer a version of a
                    bacteria-killing drug that was previously toxic in humans,
                    so that it would be safe to use.

                    The prognosis for patients with dangerous bacterial
                    infections has worsened in recent years as
                    antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains spread and the
                    development of new treatment options has stalled. However,
                    UT researchers say AI tools are game-changing.

                    [...] Large language models, or LLMs, were originally
                    designed to generate and explore sequences of text, but
                    scientists are finding creative ways to apply these models
                    to other domains. For example, just as sentences are made up
                    of sequences of words, proteins are made up of sequences of
                    amino acids. LLMs cluster together words that share common
                    attributes (such as cat, dog, and hamster) in what’s known
                    as an “embedding space” with thousands of dimensions.
                    Similarly, proteins with similar functions, like the ability
                    to fight off dangerous bacteria without hurting the people
                    who host said bacteria, may cluster together in their own
                    version of an AI embedding space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The space containing all molecules is enormous,” said
                    Davies, co-senior author of the new paper. “Machine learning
                    allows us to find the areas of chemical space that have the
                    properties we’re interested in, and it can do it so much
                    more quickly and thoroughly than standard one-at-a-time lab
                    approaches.”

                  <p>
                    For this project, the researchers employed AI to identify
                    ways to reengineer an existing antibiotic called Protegrin-1
                    that is great at killing bacteria, but toxic to people.
                    Protegrin-1, which is naturally produced by pigs to combat
                    infections, is part of a subtype of antibiotics called
                    antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). AMPs generally kill bacteria
                    directly by disrupting cell membranes, but many target both
                    bacterial and human cell membranes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, the researchers used
                    <a
                      href="https://cns.utexas.edu/news/research/promise-new-antibiotics-lies-shackling-tiny-toxic-tetherballs-bacteria"
                      >a high-throughput method they had previously developed</a
                    >
                    to create more than 7,000 variations of Protegrin-1 and
                    quickly identify areas of the AMP that could be modified
                    without losing its antibiotic activity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next, they trained a protein LLM on these results so that
                    the model could evaluate millions of possible variations for
                    three features: selectively targeting bacterial membranes,
                    potently killing bacteria and not harming human red blood
                    cells to find those that fell in the sweet spot of all
                    three. The model then helped guide the team to a safer, more
                    effective version of Protegrin-1, which they dubbed
                    bacterially selective Protegrin-1.2 (bsPG-1.2).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mice infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria and treated
                    with bsPG-1.2 were much less likely to have detectable
                    bacteria in their organs six hours after infection, compared
                    to untreated mice. If further testing offers similarly
                    positive results, the researchers hope eventually to take a
                    version of the AI-informed antibiotic drug into human
                    trials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Machine learning’s impact is twofold,” Davies said. “It’s
                    going to point out new molecules that could have the
                    potential to help people, and it’s going to show us how we
                    can take those existing antibiotic molecules and make them
                    better and focus our work to more quickly get those to
                    clinical practice.”

                in nearly every city, places where people were promised food and
                shelter while employment was scarce, but quickly became
                overcrowded and with poor living conditions. The general public
                is mostly unaware of the conditions within the sanctuary
                districts, whose residents are prevented from leaving and have
                largely been forgotten. The residents are referred to by slang

                guards, took hostages, and seized control of the sanctuary's
                processing center for incoming residents. Despite rumors that

                prevented this from happening. Bell was able to broadcast from
                the district and inform the public of the living conditions
                within the district, which brought the living conditions to the
                general public's attention and spurred on reforms.

                However, when Sisko is attacked on August 31 by a gang of
                ghosts, Gabriel Bell is killed by a ghost named B.C. while
                trying to help Sisko fend off off the attackers. This alters the
                timeline, and Sisko assumes the role of Bell to try to restore
                the proper course of history. There is no longer a Federation in
                the 24th century, no evidence of advanced technology on Earth,
                and there is a Romulan outpost at Alpha Centuary. Chief O'Brien
                and Major Kira use the transporters to travel back in time to a
                few points in history to try to find the missing crew members
                and restore the timeline. The episode's script includes this

                    sure?<br /><b>O'BRIEN:</b> Because we were just there. And
                    that wasn't the mid-twenty first century I read about in
                    school. It's been changed. I mean, Earth history has been
                    through its rough patches, but never that rough.

                In the Star Trek universe, 2048 occurs within
                <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/World_War_III"
                  >World War III</a
                >, which includes the use of strategic nuclear weapons by the
                United States, China, and Russia. This leads to a nuclear winter
                and the collapse of society. Past Tense was written to examine
                the issue of homelessness, specifically that homeless people are
                moved out of view of the general public and are forgotten about.
                There is a contrast of the extreme wealth of people like Chris
                Brynner and the destitution in the sanctuary districts. The
                story also serves as a warning that failing to address societal
                inequality may lead to more severe problems in the future, in
                this case making WWIII and the societal collapse far worse. One
                of the writers, Ira Steven Behr, commented that B.C. is not
                viewed as a murderer despite killing the real Gabriel Bell
                because society forced him into the situation, and he was just
                trying to survive the conditions in the sanctuary district. In
                2021, writer Robert Hewitt Wolfe said about the episode:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    "As a writer, all you can do is be a voice in the
                    wilderness, sometimes. You can yell, 'Fire!' but you can't
                    put it out. It's disappointing that we're still grappling
                    with this problem. I certainly would have hoped it would be
                    better by now, and people would be like, 'Ha! Remember that
                    Deep Space Nine episode that said homelessness would still
                    be a problem in the 2020s? They were so gloomy!' But one of
                    the themes of the show is that paradise doesn't come for
                    free. Even if it does get handed to you, you have to
                    continually work to protect it and renew it and advance it."

              <p>
                Deep Space Nine is my favorite of all of the Star Trek series,
                and these are two of my favorite episodes. Although some people
                criticized the story for being too preachy and politicized, when
                it was wrapped up by Sisko, Bashir, and Dax restoring the
                timeline, I considered it a very memorable and compelling story.
                World War III, which begins in 2026, is mentioned in multiple
                series as a disastrous event for humanity, and although I'm not
                aware of this being shown on screen, this story does fill in
                some of the prelude up to the war. Have any readers seen this
                two-part episode? If so, what are your thoughts on this story
                and the themes it examines?

                    Tangsuan, a doctor at NYU Langone in New York City, who
                    passed away after eating a meal at Raglan Road Irish Pub in
                    Disney Springs in October 2023.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tangsuan had a severe dairy and nut allergy and informed the
                    waitstaff at the restaurant of her dietary needs, and was
                    "unequivocally assured" they could be accommodated. She
                    ordered and ate the "Sure I'm Frittered" vegetarian broccoli
                    and corn fritters, the "Scallop Forest" sea scallops
                    appetizer, the "This Shepherd Went Vegan" entree, and a side
                    of onion rings.

                    [...] In the latest update for the Disney Springs wrongful
                    death lawsuit, Disney cited legal language within the terms
                    and conditions for Disney+, which "requires users to
                    arbitrate all disputes with the company." Disney claims
                    Piccolo reportedly agreed to this in 2019 when signing up
                    for a one-month free trial of the streaming service on his
                    PlayStation console.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the May 31 motion filed to move the wrongful death
                    lawsuit to arbitration, Disney attorneys said that the
                    Disney+ subscriber agreement states that any dispute, except
                    for small claims, "must be resolved by individual binding
                    arbitration." Disney says that similar language was agreed
                    to by Piccolo when he used the My Disney Experience app to
                    purchase tickets to visit EPCOT at Walt Disney World in
                    September 2023. Tangsuan died before she and Piccolo could
                    use the tickets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Attorneys for Piccolo called Disney's latest motion
                    "preposterous," and that it's "'absurd' to believe that the
                    153 million subscribers to the popular streaming service
                    have waived all claims against the company and its
                    affiliates because of language 'buried' within the terms and
                    conditions," according to Newsday.

                    economy and weak demand.

                    possibly alongside its fourth-quarter results on Wednesday.
                    The publication writes that the number of people being let
                    go is likely to match or be higher than the 4,000 employees
                    laid off in February. The company had nearly 85,000 workers
                    at the end of fiscal 2023; this count does not include the
                    effects of the previous round of layoffs.

                    of cybersecurity specialist Splunk in March, a purchase that
                    Cisco hopes will reduce its reliance on one-time equipment
                    sales by boosting its subscription offerings.

                    As with so many recent layoffs in the tech world, AI has
                    once again played a part in people losing their jobs. Cisco
                    launched a $1 billion fund to make investments in AI
                    startups in June, and it has made 20 AI-focused acquisitions
                    and investments in the last several years. Cost cutting
                    helps offset these big investments, and fears that returns
                    on AI spending won't match the money being poured into the
                    industry isn't helping matters.

                    A recent study has found that 94% of spreadsheets used in
                    business decision-making contain errors, posing serious
                    risks for financial losses and operational mistakes. This
                    finding highlights the need for better quality assurance
                    practices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study, led by Prof. Pak-Lok Poon in collaboration with
                    Central Queensland University, Swinburne University of
                    Technology, City University of Hong Kong, and The Royal
                    Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, shows that most spreadsheets
                    used in important business applications have errors that can
                    affect decision-making processes. "The high rate of errors
                    in these spreadsheets is concerning," says Prof. Poon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Errors in spreadsheets can lead to poor decisions, resulting

                    problems in fields like health care and nuclear operations.
                    "These mistakes can cause major issues in various sectors,"

                    Space weather forecasters at NOAA had been monitoring at
                    least five CMEs that erupted from the Sun since last week in
                    anticipation that some may be headed towards Earth. “Some
                    seem to have missed Earth, some clipped Earth, and then
                    eventually one of those we were anticipating was much more
                    of a good punch,” Shawn Dahl, service coordinator for the

                    of sunspots since 2002. CMEs typically erupt from regions on
                    the Sun with increased amounts of magnetic flux associated
                    with sunspots, and so far the Sun has sprouted 299 sunspots
                    during its current solar cycle.

                    It’s obvious that the Sun isn’t stopping anytime soon.
                    “Bottom line is, we’re going to be under the influence of
                    increased activity all of this year, all of next year, and
                    even in 2026 where we’ll continue to have higher chances
                    this type of activity to continue to happen from time to

                    we’re experiencing,” Dahl said.

                    In San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood, neighbors
                    say repeated honking from Waymo driverless cars is
                    disturbing their sleep.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Multiple residents in high-rise buildings off of 2nd Street
                    near Harrison Street told NBC Bay Area News they have been
                    hearing Waymo vehicles honking in a nearby parking lot for
                    the past several weeks. They said that the lot began to be
                    occupied by Waymo vehicles just a few weeks ago. The Waymos
                    appear to go to the lot to rest in between rides.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Christopher Cherry who lives in the building next door said
                    he was "really excited" to have Waymo in the neighborhood,
                    thinking it would bring more security and quiet to the area.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We started out with a couple of honks here and there, and
                    then as more and more cars started to arrive, the situation
                    got worse, " Cherry said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cherry said the honking happens daily at different levels,
                    with the most intense honking occurring at around 4:00 a.m.
                    and at evening rush hour times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Videos from residents of these incidents show Waymo
                    cars filing into the parking lot, and then attempting to
                    back into spots, which appears to trigger honking from the
                    other Waymo cars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Neighbors note, there is no one in the cars that they
                    can flag down and ask to stop the honking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I think the most frustrating thing about this is that there
                    is just nobody to talk to, and even at the corporate level,
                    I am finding it difficult, not impossible," White said.

                    The CrowdStrike outage was a massive global event, which has
                    now been recognised with a massive Pwnie Award trophy. The
                    two-tiered trophy awarded to CrowdStrike dwarfed the smaller
                    pony-shaped ones for other categories, as befitting the
                    eclipsing size of its blunder.

                  <p>
                    "Definitely not the award to be proud of receiving,"
                    <a href="https://x.com/singe/status/1822324795645575263"
                      >Sentonas said in his acceptance speech</a
                    >, taking the stage to laughter and applause. "I think the
                    team was surprised when I said straight away that I'd be
                    coming to get it. We got this horribly wrong, we've said
                    that a number of different times. It's super important to
                    own it when you do things well, it's super important to own
                    it when you do things horribly wrong, which we did in this
                    case."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Accepting the large golden trophy, Sentonas stated that he
                    intended to display it at CrowdStrike's headquarters in
                    Austin, Texas. His hope is that it will serve as a reminder
                    to CrowdStrike's staff to prevent such mistakes from
                    happening in the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The reason why I wanted the trophy is I'm heading back to
                    headquarters," Sentosas continued. "I'm gonna take the
                    trophy with me, it's gonna sit pride of place, because I
                    want every CrowdStriker who comes to work to see it. Because
                    our goal is to protect people, and we got this wrong, and I
                    want to make sure that everybody understands these things
                    can't happen, and that's what this community's about. So
                    from that perspective I will say thank you."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sentonas' in-person acceptance of CrowdStrike's Pwnie Award
                    was widely well-received, with social media users praising
                    him for accepting accountability with humility, class, and
                    good humour.

                    Though CrowdStrike's Most Epic Fail trophy was only awarded
                    this weekend, its win had already been announced alongside

                  <p>
                    In a post to X at the time, the Pwnie Awards stated that it
                    was granting the early award due to
                    <a

                    >
                    Said circumstance was likely the fact that CrowdStrike's
                    fail was so epic that no one was likely to match it unless
                    they deliberately tried. Even then, it would still be a
                    difficult task.

                    While all other categories at the 2024 Pwnie Awards had
                    three finalists, CrowdStrike had no competition for the Epic
                    Fail Award. Instead,

                    submitted to the US District Court for the Southern District
                    of Florida claims the exposed personal data belongs to a
                    public records data provider named National Public Data,
                    which specializes in background checks and fraud prevention.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The personal data of 2.9 billion people, which includes full
                    names, former and complete addresses going back 30 years,
                    <a

                      >Social Security Numbers</a

                    cybercriminal group that goes by the name
                    <a
                      href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/online-security/hackers-have-leaked-the-criminal-records-of-millions-of-americans-online-how-to-stay-safe"
                      >USDoD</a
                    >. The complaint goes on to explain that the hackers then
                    tried to sell this huge collection of personal data on the
                    dark web to the tune of $3.5 million. It's worth noting that
                    due to the sheer number of people affected, this data likely
                    comes from both the U.S. and other countries around the
                    world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Here's everything we know so far about this massive data
                    breach along with some steps you can take to stay safe if
                    your personal information was exposed online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So how does a firm like National Public Data obtain the
                    personal data of almost 3 billion people? The answer is
                    through scraping which is a technique used by companies to
                    collect data from web sites and other sources online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What makes the way National Public Data did this more
                    concerning is that the firm scraped personally identifiable
                    information (<a
                      href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/your-browsers-spell-check-feature-could-be-giving-away-your-passwords"
                      >PII</a
                    >) of billions of people from non-public sources. As a
                    result, many of the people who are now involved in the class
                    action lawsuit did not provide their data to the company
                    willingly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the complaint, one of the plaintiffs who
                    resides in California first found out about the breach
                    because he was using one of the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-identity-theft-protection,review-2083.html"
                      >best identity theft protection services</a
                    >
                    which notified him that his data was exposed and leaked on
                    the dark web.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As part of the class action lawsuit, this plaintiff is
                    asking the court to have National Public Data securely
                    dispose of all the personal information it acquired through
                    scraping. However, he also wants the firm to compensate him
                    and the other victims financially while implementing
                    stricter security measures going forward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With full names, addresses and Social Security Numbers in
                    hand, there's a lot that hackers can do with this
                    information, especially when it was made available for sale
                    on the dark web.
