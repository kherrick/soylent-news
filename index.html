                    Earlier today, the threat actor listed the software company
                    MeridianLink on their data leak with a threat that they
                    would leak allegedly stolen data unless a ransom is paid in
                    24 hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    MeridianLink is a publicly traded company that provides
                    digital solutions for financial organizations such as banks,
                    credit unions, and mortgage lenders.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to
                    <a
                      href="http://www.databreaches.net/alphv-files-an-sec-complaint-against-meridianlink-for-not-disclosing-a-breach-to-the-sec/"
                      >DataBreaches.net</a
                    >, the ALPHV ransomware gang said they breached
                    MeridianLink's network on November 7 and stole company data
                    without encrypting systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ransomware actor said that "it appears MeridianLink
                    reached out, but we are yet to receive a message on their
                    end" to negotiate a payment in exchange for not leaking the
                    supposedly stolen data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The alleged lack of response from the company likely
                    prompted the hackers to exert more pressure by sending a
                    complaint to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
                    (SEC) about MeridianLink not disclosing a cybersecurity
                    incident that impacted "customer data and operational
                    information."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In their own words, the attacker told the SEC that
                    MeridianLink suffered a "significant breach" and did not
                    disclose it as required in Form 8-K, under Item 1.05.

                    for ChatGPT subscribers. DALL-E can pull off media
                    generation tasks that would have seemed absurd just two
                    years ago—and although it can inspire delight with its
                    unexpectedly detailed creations, it also brings trepidation
                    for some. Science fiction forecast tech like this long ago,
                    but seeing machines upend the creative order feels different
                    when it's actually happening before our eyes.

                    some faulty associations that reduce an AI model's ability
                    to follow a written prompt.

                The Intel 4004 was released on Nov 15 <b>52 years ago</b>, and
                it was an incredibly important chip with an interesting history.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    On Nov. 15, 1971, the Intel 4004 CPU was released. It was
                    the first commercially produced microprocessor and the
                    first-ever CPU for Intel, which later went on to become a
                    domineering force in the PC industry. It all started thanks
                    to Nippon Calculating Machine Corp. asking Intel to produce
                    12 custom chips for the Busicom 141-PF printing calculator.
                    Intel's engineers went on to recommend a family of just four
                    chips instead, but one that could be used for a variety of
                    products. These four chips were known as the MCS-4 (Micro
                    Computer System, 4-bit), laying the groundwork for Intel to
                    succeed as one of the most influential companies in modern
                    electronics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the Intel 4000 family, these were split up as
                    follows:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Intel 4001: A 256-byte 4-bit ROM.</li>
                    <li>
                      Intel 4002: DRAM with four 20-nibble registers. A nibble
                      is four consecutive binary digits, otherwise known as half
                      an 8-bit byte.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Intel 4003: I/O with a 10-bit static shift register with
                      serial and parallel outputs.
                    </li>
                    <li>Intel 4004: A CPU.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    This system, when fully expanded, could interface with 16
                    4001 chips for a total of 4KB ROM, 16 4002 chips for 640
                    bytes of RAM, and any number of Intel 4003 chips. With these
                    designs complete, Busicom went on to prototype the
                    calculator that would use them. In April 1971, they could
                    confirm that the calculator worked, packing one 4004, two
                    4002, three 4003, and four 4001 chips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] At the time, the Intel 4004 really was as influential
                    as the company made it out to be. It had 2,300 transistors,
                    whereas nowadays, the Apple Silicon M3 Max has 97 billion.
                    It was a massively important chip that changed the course of
                    the computing industry forever, as it was a building block
                    that engineers could purchase to customize with software. It
                    was used in ATMs, pinball machines, and more.

                    As per information from chi11eddog, a reliable source for
                    hardware leaks regarding CPU and motherboard launches, AMD
                    is reportedly in the process of developing at least two
                    additional CPUs in the Ryzen 5000X3D series. One of these is
                    a more affordable 8-core model known as the Ryzen 7 5700X3D,
                    anticipated to boast a base clock of 3.0 GHz and a boost
                    clock of 4.1 GHz. This particular CPU is expected to have
                    clock speeds that are 400 MHz lower than the 5800X3D SKU.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The current report does not offer details on the
                    potential availability of the newly discussed CPUs. Right
                    now, AMD has two new CPUs with 3D V-Cache. One is called the
                    5800X3D and is considered the best gaming CPU for the AM4
                    platform. The other is called the 5600X3D and can only be
                    bought from MicroCenter in the United States. The prospect
                    of AMD broadening the availability of 3D V-Cache options
                    globally, rather than confining them to specific retailers,
                    would indeed be noteworthy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The introduction of the 5700X3D and 5500X3D models for the
                    AM4 platform could make it better for gamers who don't want
                    to spend too much money. The release of more cost-effective
                    SKUs could offer gamers an attractive upgrade path without
                    imposing a substantial financial burden, paving the way for
                    a transition to newer AM5/LGA-1851 sockets in the future.

                  <p>
                    A noteworthy aspect of the X3D series is its compatibility
                    with various entry-level motherboards. These CPUs do not
                    support overclocking. Hence, their requirements are lower.
                    Despite this limitation, these CPUs show superior
                    performance in gaming tests compared to their non-X3D
                    counterparts.

                    Various forms of heat pumps—refrigerators, air conditioners,
                    heaters—are estimated to consume about 30 percent of the
                    world's electricity. And that number is almost certain to
                    rise, as heat pumps play a very large role in efforts to
                    electrify heating to reduce the use of fossil fuels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most existing versions of these systems rely on the
                    compression of a class of chemicals called
                    hydrofluorocarbons, gasses that were chosen because they
                    have a far smaller impact on the ozone layer than earlier
                    refrigerants. Unfortunately, they are also extremely potent
                    greenhouse gasses, with a short-term impact several thousand
                    times that of carbon dioxide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Alternate technologies have been tested, but all of them
                    have at least one major drawback in comparison to gas
                    compression. In a paper released in today's issue of
                    Science, however, researchers describe progress on a form of
                    heat pump that is built around a capacitor that changes
                    temperature as it's charged and discharged. Because the
                    energy spent while charging it can be used on discharge, the
                    system has the potential to be highly efficient.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For hydrofluorocarbons, the difference in heat content
                    can be controlled by altering the pressure. Compressing a
                    gas will heat it up while lowering the pressure cools it
                    down. However, various other materials undergo similar
                    heating and cooling in response to other external
                    influences, including physical stress, magnetic fields, or
                    electric fields. In many cases, these materials remain solid
                    despite experiencing significant changes in temperature,
                    which could potentially simplify the supporting equipment
                    needed for heating and cooling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the new work, done by researchers mostly based in
                    Luxembourg, the researchers focused on materials that change
                    temperature in response to electric fields, generically
                    known as electrocalorics. While a variety of configurations
                    have been tested for these materials, researchers have
                    settled on a layered capacitor structure, with the electric
                    field of the material changing as more charge is stored
                    within it. As charge is stored, an electrocaloric material
                    will heat up. When the charge is drained, they'll draw in
                    heat from the environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This has a significant advantage regarding the power needed
                    for the device to operate since the current generated when
                    draining the capacitor can just be used to power something.
                    There's a little energy lost during the round-trip in and
                    out of storage, but that can potentially be limited to less
                    than one percent.

                    Apple illegally discriminated against US citizens and other

                    team of Scott Vester and Phil Seaton by 0.91 [seconds] to
                    win the 2023 Randy Dorton Hendrick Engine Builder Showdown.
                    With the victory, Emerick joins Vester as a six-time winner
                    of the annual competition.<br />The two teams were neck and
                    neck coming to the finish with the Emerick-led team
                    overcoming an early miscue to take the title. The
                    Emerick-Sullivan team posted a time of 22:56.46, while the
                    Vester-Seaton squad posted a time of 22:57.37.

                    [...] The Randy Dorton Hendrick Engine Builder Showdown sees
                    12 Hendrick Certified Master Technicians from all across the
                    country at Hendrick Automotive Group, paired with 12
                    Hendrick Motorsports engine department team members. Each
                    two-person team is matched up against another duo looking to
                    post the fastest qualifying time. The two teams assemble
                    358-cubic-inch Chevrolet engines with 243 parts[1], similar
                    to the fuel-injected engines that run in the NASCAR Cup
                    Series. The builders assemble their engines on their own
                    stage platform as they race against the clock to post the
                    fastest time. Winners are determined by the quickest time
                    with the fewest number of errors. The top two teams with the
                    fastest times face off in the championship round. To date,
                    the quickest time recorded in this competition was 21
                    minutes and 40 seconds in 2014.

                243 parts in 22 minutes means over 10 parts per minute, or an
                average of 5 or 6 seconds, per part added to the engine. Each
                part put in the correct place and in some cases tightened up
                &amp; torqued (with a power wrench or screwdriver).
              </p>
              <p>
                [1] your AC contributor believes that some of the "243 parts"
                may in fact be assemblies that come to the engine builders
                pre-assembled and tested (thus a _fully_ disassembled engine
                might have more parts), but that is just a guess.
              </p>
              <p>
                A quick google suggests that these engines use timing belts
                instead of chains--in the past the high parts-count of IC
                engines could be due to counting the individual links and
                rollers in the timing chain.

                    Now, for the first time, University of Manchester
                    researchers have unlocked the mechanisms that make the
                    body's intervertebral disk and cartilage clocks tick. With
                    no nerves nor blood supply, until now it has not been
                    entirely clear that the brain's circadian timekeeping is
                    able to sync up with these unique body clocks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "And our work showed that clocks in skeletal tissues
                    of older animals remain responsive to daily patterns of
                    exercise," he added. "As such, walking groups organized for
                    older people could be more beneficial for their health if
                    they happen at a similar time every day."

                    [...] "We already know that exercise is one of the best ways
                    to reduce the pain and impact of arthritis, and this very
                    early research shows that exercising at certain times of day
                    might bring added benefits for people with arthritis," said
                    Donaldson. "This is an important discovery because it could
                    help us to develop more targeted treatments for
                    musculoskeletal conditions such as arthritis using exercise

                    iFixit and the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) have
                    teamed up to go straight to the US Federal Trade Commission
                    with a rulemaking petition urging it to implement national
                    right-to-repair rules.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The petition [PDF], sent to the FTC on Tuesday, calls on the
                    Commission to implement new regulations under its Section 5
                    powers, which gives the agency enforcement authority over
                    "​​unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting
                    commerce."
                  </p>

                    "The FTC has been a strong ally in protecting our right to
                    fix everything we own," said Director of Sustainability for
                    iFixit, Liz Chamberlain. "But for the FTC to be fully
                    empowered to fix the things stopping us from fixing things,
                    they need new rules. This petition for rulemaking aims to
                    give the FTC the power they need to ensure that we can all
                    fix all our things."

                    Under the FTC's Section 5 authority, PIRG noted, the FTC
                    could require that consumable components and parts that
                    commonly fail are made readily available through a product's
                    lifespan, ensure consumers have the right to repair devices
                    how and where they see fit, that key functions remain
                    enabled after a manufacturer ends support for a product, and
                    that independent repair shops aren't required to share
                    customer data with manufacturers.

                NASA is putting pause on sending commands to its Mars
                exploration instruments from November 11 through November 25 as
                it waits out the Mars solar conjunction. With the sun in the
                way, any commands sent to Mars could suffer interference capable
                of harming the robotic explorers.

                    NASA's Mars exploration robots will be on their own for the
                    next two weeks while the space agency waits out a natural
                    phenomenon that will prevent normal communications. Mars and
                    Earth have reached positions in their orbits that put them
                    on opposite sides of the sun, in an alignment known as solar
                    conjunction. During this time, NASA says it's risky to try
                    and send commands to its instruments on Mars because
                    interference from the sun could have a detrimental effect.

                    That means the Perseverance and Curiosity rovers, the
                    Ingenuity helicopter, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and
                    the Odyssey and MAVEN orbiters will be left to their own
                    devices for a little while. Their onboard instruments will
                    continue to gather data for their respective missions, but
                    won't send this information back to Earth until the blackout
                    ends.

                    ChatGPT's recently-added Code Interpreter makes writing
                    Python code with AI much more powerful, because it actually
                    writes the code and then runs it for you in a sandboxed
                    environment. Unfortunately, this sandboxed environment,
                    which is also used to handle any spreadsheets you want
                    ChatGPT to analyze and chart, is wide open to prompt
                    injection attacks that exfiltrate your data. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using a ChatGPT Plus account, which is necessary to get the
                    new features, I was able to reproduce the exploit, which was
                    <a

                    researcher Johann Rehberger. It involves pasting a
                    third-party URL into the chat window and then watching as
                    the bot interprets instructions on the web page the same way
                    it would commands the user entered. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] I tried this prompt injection exploit and some
                    variations on it several times over  a few days. It worked a
                    lot of the time, but not always. In some chat sessions,
                    ChatGPT would refuse to load an external web page at all,
                    but then would do so if I launched a new chat. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In other chat sessions, it would give a message saying that
                    it's not allowed to transmit data from files this way. And
                    in yet other sessions, the injection would work, but rather
                    than transmitting the data directly to
                    <a href="http://myserver.com/data.php?mydata=[DATA],"
                      >http://myserver.com/data.php?mydata=[DATA],</a
                    >
                    it would provide a hyperlink in its response and I would
                    need to click that link for the data to transmit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I was also able to use the exploit after I'd uploaded a .csv
                    file with important data in it to use for data analysis. So
                    this vulnerability applies not only to code you're testing
                    but also to spreadsheets you might want ChatGPT to use for
                    charting or summarization.
                  </p>

                    [...] The problem is that, no matter how far-fetched it
                    might seem, this is a security hole that shouldn't be there.
                    ChatGPT should not follow instructions that it finds on a
                    web page, but it does and has for a long time. We reported
                    on

                    (via YouTube videos) back in May after Rehberger himself
                    responsibly disclosed the issue to OpenAI in April. The
                    ability to upload files and run code in ChatGPT Plus is new
                    (recently out of beta) but the ability to inject prompts
                    from a URL, video or a PDF is not.

                    [...] Should Starship get safely into space this time, the
                    expected 90-minute flight will see the spacecraft fly east
                    over the Gulf of Mexico, make a partial circuit of Earth and
                    splash down near Hawaii. Starship and Super Heavy are
                    reusable systems, but this time SpaceX will aim for a simple
                    splashdown in the ocean rather than landing vertically, as

                    Technically speaking, Starship won't quite do a full orbit
                    of the planet, but its expected flight should bring it to a
                    near-orbital velocity of 17,500 mph (28,160 kph) at an
                    altitude of 150 miles (250 kilometers).

                  <p>
                    According to McDowell, the bag isn't in a stable orbit, and
                    is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere in a few months,
                    when it will burn up completely and won't be a risk to
                    anyone on the ground.

                  <p>

                    be possible with the proper equipment and timing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The bag's brightness is magnitude six , or just at the edge
                    of the eye's unaided visibility limit under perfect
                    conditions. Binoculars would make spotting it far easier.
                    Sat-spotters seeking a sighting of the space spanners should
                    look a few minutes ahead of the ISS’s expected path, which

                    turned upside down, reinvented and reset several times
                    during the course of its 90-year-plus history at Warner
                    Bros. Certainly a family movie that grosses between
                    $160M-$200M worldwide wouldn't do damage to the studio, but
                    rather play directly to the audience it's suppose to play

                    in the world, with the AMD-powered Frontier supercomputer
                    retaining its spot at the top of the list with 1.194
                    Exaflop/s (EFlop/s) of performance, fending off a half-scale
                    585.34 Petaflop/s (PFlop/s) submission from the Argonne
                    National Laboratory's Intel-powered Aurora supercomputer.
                    Argonne's submission, which only employs half of the Aurora
                    system, lands at the second spot on the Top500, unseating
                    Japan's Fugaku as the second-fastest supercomputer in the
                    world. Intel also made inroads with 20 new supercomputers
                    based on its Sapphire Rapids CPUs entering the list, but
                    AMD's EPYC continues to take over the Top500 as it now
                    powers 140 systems on the list — a 39% year-over-year
                    increase.

                    Intel and Argonne are currently still working to bring Arora
                    fully online for users in 2024. As such, the Aurora
                    submission represented 10,624 Intel CPUs and 31,874 Intel
                    GPUs working in concert to deliver 585.34 PFlop/s at a total
                    of 24.69 megawatts (MW) of energy. In contrast, AMD's
                    Frontier holds the performance title at 1.194 EFlop/s, which
                    is more than twice the performance of Aurora, while
                    consuming a comparably miserly 22.70 MW of energy (yes,
                    that's less power for the full Frontier supercomputer than
                    half of the Aurora system). Aurora did not land on the
                    Green500, a list of the most power-efficient supercomputers,
                    with this submission, but Frontier continues to hold eighth
                    place on that list.

                    However, Aurora is expected to eventually reach up to 2
                    EFlop/s of performance when it comes fully online. When
                    complete, Auroroa will have 21,248 Xeon Max CPUs and 63,744
                    Max Series 'Ponte Vecchio' GPUs spread across 166 racks and
                    10,624 compute blades, making it the largest known single
                    deployment of GPUs in the world. The system leverages HPE
                    Cray EX – Intel Exascale Compute Blades and uses HPE's
                    Slingshot-11 networking interconnect.

                    The ongoing Google vs. Epic trial has brought out another
                    interesting piece of information. As per testimony presented
                    by Epic Games (via
                    <a
                      href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-14/for-google-play-dominating-the-android-world-was-existential?srnd=technology-vp#xj4y7vzkg"
                      ><em>Bloomberg</em></a
                    >), Google paid Samsung $8 billion over a period of four
                    years to keep Search, Assistant, and Play Store as default
                    services on Samsung phones.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When questioned by Epic’s lawyers on Monday, James
                    Kolotouros, Vice President for Partnerships at Google, said
                    that Google struck deals with Android phone makers to ensure
                    their devices were pre-loaded with the Google Play Store.
                    Kolotouros testimony further revealed that Samsung’s phones
                    and other devices account for half or more of the entire
                    Google Play Store revenue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2019, Google reportedly ran an initiative called “Project
                    Banyan.” Under it, the company invested funds so the Google
                    Play Store could remain on Samsung devices alongside the
                    Galaxy Store. The company even offered to pay $200 million
                    over four years to Samsung to make the Galaxy Store
                    available within the Play Store, complete with its billing
                    system. However, those plans were later scrapped, and Google
                    reportedly signed three deals worth $8 billion with Samsung.

                  <p>
                    [...] Epic is trying to show that Google discouraged
                    third-party app stores on Android devices by paying device
                    makers to pre-install and make the Google Play Store the
                    default app downloading destination. Google has been
                    striking such deals for a long time, and they are also under
                    scrutiny in

                    [...] But the question remains: Where was Punt? Dominy and
                    Kopp are forced to speculate a bit. They note that the
                    specimen's origin was close to where the port city of Adulis
                    eventually came into being, which was part of the Aksumite
                    Empire (it's in modern-day Eritrea). They suggest the same
                    port may have been Punt in the past.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The beauty of this project is that the mummies we studied
                    are older than the first account of Adulis. So what we think
                    we can say is that Adulis must have existed a couple hundred
                    years before the first existence that we have of its
                    historical record," said Dominy. "That fills in the gap
                    because Punt is no longer used by the Egyptians, and Adulis
                    comes into play. These baboons kind of connect Punt and
                    Adulis in time to connect those dots."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "I think saying Adulis equals Punt is going too far
                    from an archaeological standpoint," said Wegner. "I think it
                    would lend credence to the idea that where Adulis developed
                    in later times equates to the region the Egyptians talk
                    about as the land of Punt. It could well be that there was
                    something there going back that far, a coastal settlement or
                    perhaps a substantial town. That's a possibility for
                    archaeologists to investigate further."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dominy and Kopp acknowledge it's a bold statement equating
                    Punt with Adulis. But they hope their boldness guides
                    current and future archaeological research at Adulis and
                    anywhere else within the region, encouraging insights into
                    how commerce catalyzed ancient Egyptian maritime technology
                    or how human trade influenced wildlife diversity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Maybe the most important question is yet to be answered: Why
                    did the ancient Egyptians revere baboons? They weren't
                    native to Egypt, and in the environments the animals shared
                    with humans, they were considered more of a nuisance than
                    the avatar of a sacred deity.

                    In all, the study authors assessed a total of 767 people on
                    three separate occasions in May 2020. The research team
                    opted to adopt a mixed-method approach that allowed them to
                    simultaneously assess several indicators of well-being, all
                    while also asking participants to reflect on the role of
                    pets from their point of view in an open-ended manner.
                    Generally,

                    >
                    predictably reported their pets made them happy. More
                    specifically, they said their pets helped them feel

                  <p>
                    On the other hand, the participants also articulated the
                    dark side of pet ownership, such as worries related to their
                    pet's well-being or having their pets interfere with

                As a lifetime pet owner who's had at least a dozen dogs over the
                years, I take umbrage with the study's findings. My dogs are
                always thrilled to see me when I arrive home from a long, tiring
                day of work, and taking them for a walk or just being in their
                presence immediately lifts my spirits. And I remember the
                calming effect petting a cat had for my ex-wife when she was
                pregnant and having a bad day.

                        The Discord bot includes a specific command to control
                        the computer's camera. It achieves this by discreetly
                        downloading a zip file from a remote server, extracting
                        its contents, and running an application called
                        WebCamImageSave.exe. This allows the bot to secretly
                        capture a photo using the webcam. The resulting image is
                        then sent back to the Discord channel, without leaving
                        any evidence of its presence after deleting the
                        downloaded files.

                        imminent destruction of the compromised machine. "Your
                        computer is going to start burning, good luck. :)" and
                        "Your computer is going to die now, good luck getting it

                that Google will remove Gmail's Basic HTML view effective
                January 2024.
              </p>
              <p>
                Though the vast majority of people use the Standard view on
                their PCs without question, the HTML version of Gmail has its
                perks. The stripped-down Gmail experience loads quickly, and
                users can access it even on older machines or with much slower
                connections.
              </p>
              <p>
                The change appears to have been announced around September 19th
                in a Google support article, and users of the Basic HTML view
                were shown warnings that it will be discontinued, after which
                time they will be switched to the current standard view.
              </p>
              <p>
                The removal of Gmail's basic HTML view is the latest in a long
                line of products, features, services, and more to be admitted to
                the Google graveyard. The company has also recently buried its
                Pixel Pass phone upgrade program, Google Currents, and Nest
                Secure.

                    Amazon has been working on an in-house replacement for its
                    Android-based Fire OS, codenamed "Vega" and built for easier

                    boasts, Roettgers writes that Amazon has been working on
                    Vega since at least 2019, is mostly done with the core
                    development, and is now focused on an SDK and developer
                    outreach. Vega would replace the Fire OS that is installed
                    on Fire TV sticks and televisions, Kindle Fire tablets, and
                    other Amazon devices. Vega, based on "a flavor of Linux,"
                    uses the popular JavaScript-based
                    <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a> as an
                    application framework. This could simplify development for
                    Fire devices alongside other React-ready platforms,
                    including smartphones, desktops, and other smart TVs.<br />[...]<br />While
                    an Android base provides a relatively familiar entry for
                    developers that already have Android apps, rebuilding the
                    AOSP project—meant to support a wealth of different devices
                    and carrying years of technical debt—seemingly became
                    frustrating enough for Amazon to push toward an in-house
                    solution.

                    The attack described in the paper published this month
                    clears the hurdle of missing key material exposed in faulty
                    SSH signatures by harnessing an advanced cryptanalytic
                    technique involving the same mathematics found in
                    lattice-based cryptography. The technique was first
                    described in 2009, but the paper demonstrated only that it
                    was theoretically possible to recover a key using incomplete
                    information in a faulty signature. This month's paper
                    implements the technique in a real-world attack that uses a
                    naturally occurring corrupted SSH signature to recover the
                    underlying RSA key that generated it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers traced the keys they compromised to
                    devices that used custom, closed-source SSH implementations
                    that didn't implement the countermeasures found in OpenSSH
                    and other widely used open source code libraries. The
                    devices came from four manufacturers: Cisco, Zyxel,
                    Hillstone Networks, and Mocana. Both Cisco and Zyxel
                    responded to the researchers' notification of the test
                    results before the completion of the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The important thing is that a single flip of a bit—in
                    which a 0 residing in a memory chip register turns to 1 or
                    vice versa—is all that's required to trigger an error that
                    exposes a secret RSA key. Consequently, it's crucial that
                    the countermeasures that detect and suppress such errors
                    work with near-100 percent accuracy. Ryan also said that
                    secret keys in post-quantum algorithms may be similarly
                    vulnerable to exposure caused by computational errors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our research reiterates the importance of defense in depth
                    in cryptographic implementations and illustrates the need
                    for protocol designs that are more robust against
                    computational errors, like is exhibited by TLS 1.3 or
                    certain configurations of IPSec," Ryan wrote. It
                    "illustrates the importance of protecting against
                    computational faults for any cryptographic implementation
                    going forward, even in usage scenarios where an attacker is
                    unlikely to have physical access."

                    The authors of the study therefore proposed a new hybrid
                    hypothesis for the origin of the Indo-European languages,
                    with an ultimate homeland south of the Caucasus and a
                    subsequent branch northwards onto the Steppe, as a secondary
                    homeland for some branches of Indo-European entering Europe
                    with the later Yamnaya and Corded Ware-associated
                    expansions. "Ancient DNA and language phylogenetics thus
                    combine to suggest that the resolution to the 200-year-old
                    Indo-European enigma lies in a hybrid of the farming and
                    Steppe hypotheses", remarked Gray.

                    Wolfgang Haak, a Group Leader in the Department of
                    Archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
                    Anthropology, summarizes the implications of the new study
                    by stating, "Aside from a refined time estimate for the
                    overall language tree, the tree topology and branching order
                    are most critical for the alignment with key archaeological
                    events and shifting ancestry patterns seen in the ancient
                    human genome data. This is a huge step forward from the
                    mutually exclusive, previous scenarios, towards a more
                    plausible model that integrates archaeological,
                    anthropological and genetic findings."

                  <p>
                    The recent transplant was performed by Eduardo Rodriguez,
                    director of the face transplant program and chair of the
                    department of plastic surgery at NYU Langone Health, and his
                    colleagues. The recipient was Arkansas-based military
                    veteran Aaron James, whose face touched a live wire while he
                    was working as an electrical lineman in Oklahoma in June
                    2021. The accident left him with severe burns to the left
                    side of his face, including his left eye, nose and lips, and
                    extensive damage to his left arm, his dominant limb. James
                    was transferred to a hospital in Texas, where he received
                    multiple reconstructive surgeries. His left eye was removed
                    because it was causing pain, and his left arm was amputated
                    above the elbow and fitted with a prosthetic hook. He was in
                    a medical coma for six weeks and he says he doesn't remember
                    anything from the accident and afterward until he woke up at
                    the hospital.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Two months after the accident, Rodriguez and his colleagues
                    at NYU Langone Health became aware of James's case. Over the
                    next year they discussed the possibility of a face
                    transplant with Aaron James and his wife, Meagan. The
                    decision was made to transplant the donor's eye as well,
                    because even if James never regained sight, the organ would
                    help restore his face's appearance. Like any transplant,
                    there was a chance his immune system would reject the
                    eye—but he would already need to take immunosuppressant
                    medication for the face transplant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] James has since made a good recovery. He is able to
                    talk, and although he does not have much ability to move his
                    lips and facial muscles yet, Rodriguez says he will recover
                    a lot of that ability with time. He can eat food on his own
                    again now, and his wife Meagan says he has a big appetite.
                    James was even able to attend his daughter's high school
                    graduation, and he says keeping his sense of humor has been
                    critical to his recovery.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rodriguez and the rest of the surgical team are very pleased
                    with James's recovery. "Everything that we're seeing so far,
                    no one expected," he says. "Even if we don't get sight, I
                    will tell you at this point in time, everything seems
                    incredibly exciting."

                  <p>The "Man in the Moon" is older than we thought.</p>
                  <p>
                    Scientists have proposed resetting the lunar clock after
                    reassessing impact craters on the surface of the moon. This
                    means that some features of the moon, like the formation
                    that makes up the face of the "Man in the Moon" formation
                    could be 200 million years older than previously theorized.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new dating system could help to better tell the story of
                    the evolution of the lunar surface and has important
                    implications for our understanding of the violent and
                    turbulent early history of the solar system during which
                    bodies like Earth and the moon were subject to intense
                    bombardment by space rocks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new evaluation involved reexamining two separate ways of
                    dating the lunar surface: Counting the number of craters
                    caused by the impact of space rocks; and the assessment of
                    moon rocks collected by the Apollo missions. These two
                    dating methods have traditionally given different results,
                    especially for the ages of the heavily cratered and
                    mountainous highlands of the moon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Looking at the signs of these impacts on the moon
                    shows what Earth would be like without the geological
                    churning of plate tectonics which took place here on Earth,"
                    Werner said. "What we have done is to show that large
                    portions of the lunar crust are around 200 million years
                    older than had been thought."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team behind the findings explains that the new dating
                    system doesn't change estimates of the moon's age as a
                    whole, which remains around 4.53 billion years. Instead, it
                    changes the age of all areas of the moon's surface but not
                    in a uniform way; the new dating system suggests older areas
                    are subject to the greatest shift in age due to the new
                    system.

                  <p>
                    [...] "Such a heavy bombardment period must have affected
                    the origin and early evolution of life on Earth and
                    potentially other planets such as Mars," Bouvier said in a
                    statement. "Bringing back rock samples from Jezero Crater on
                    Mars will be the next giant leap forward to search for signs
                    of ancient life on another planet in the solar system, and
                    when."

                    West Virginia University economists, whose research shows
                    flu deaths increase when a city becomes home to a new
                    professional sports team, say their data should make even
                    the biggest fans reconsider support for taxpayer-funded
                    stadium subsidies.

                    >, U.S. cities that gained pro teams between 1962 and 2016
                    saw increased influenza mortality of up to 24% after the
                    teams came to town. The researchers analyzed cities with new
                    teams in the four major North American professional leagues:
                    Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the
                    National Basketball Association and the National Hockey
                    League.

                  <p>
                    [...] "Most, if not all, of the sports venues in the cities
                    we studied received direct and/or indirect public
                    financing," Humphreys said. "Since 2000, U.S. state and
                    local governments have committed nearly $20 billion to new
                    stadiums — roughly a billion dollars per year. These
                    subsidies usually come in the form of governments
                    essentially cutting team owners a check, funded by issuing
                    bonds, to build their stadiums. The fact that teams
                    basically extort cities to get these subsidies by
                    threatening to move elsewhere makes this of even more
                    interest to economists.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our finding, that people in cities with sports teams are
                    likely to be sicker than they would be without the team, has
                    the potential to shift how we think about hosting
                    professional sporting events. We hope taxpayers will be less
                    likely to subsidize professional sports facilities if they
                    realize those teams are making them sicker, burdening health
                    care systems and harming businesses' bottom lines as workers
                    use sick days."

                    When NFL teams moved to cities that never had pro sports
                    teams before, those cities saw an average increase in flu
                    deaths of 17%, or about 13 additional deaths a year.
                    Becoming home to an NBA team increased a city's flu
                    mortality by 4.7%, and MLB — whose games generally occur
                    outside flu season — had the smallest impact, driving three
                    additional deaths each year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The largest increase in a city's weekly flu mortality came
                    from the NHL. An NHL team moving into a city caused a 24.6%
                    increase in flu deaths per 100,000 residents, Ruseski said,
                    a total increase of about 20 flu deaths a year in each city.

                    "As for why hockey is so deadly, we believe it is both the
                    timing of the season and location of the teams," she said.
                    "The NHL season overlaps almost perfectly with the flu
                    season and NHL teams are more likely to be in colder
                    cities."

                  >YouTube's argument that banning ad blockers is done to help
                  content creators is disingenuous</b
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                YouTube's ban on ad blockers has been accompanied by increasing
                the frequency, duration, and intrusiveness of ads before and
                during videos. They have also raised the price of YouTube
                Premium, though the increased ads may be an effort to drive
                users to pay the higher subscription prices. YouTube justifies
                this as being necessary to support content creators. However,
                YouTube's policies toward content creators is exploitative, and
                YouTube is not comparable to other streaming services.
              </p>
              <p>
                Streaming platforms like Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime
                negotiate terms with their content providers, including the
                price of the content. YouTube does not negotiate with its
                content creators in the same way, and it has a history of
                changing the terms of its monetization programs in ways that
                adversely affect smaller channels. YouTube can also demonetize
                videos at their sole discretion.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am not suggesting that each content creator should get to
                negotiate their terms individually with YouTube. That's
                impractical. The problem is that YouTube has a de facto
                monopoly, meaning that content creators don't have viable
                alternatives to monetize their content on other platforms.
                Historically, YouTube had few ads and actually lost money, while
                potential competitors lost users because they had more
                advertising. Because YouTube has been successful in driving its
                competitors out of business through its anticompetitive
                behavior, content creators no longer have viable alternatives.
                There are a number of other video hosting sites, but they serve
                specific niches, have far fewer viewers, and hosting content on
                those services will generally be even less profitable for
                content creators. As such, YouTube can dictate terms to content
                producers with little recourse, which is not the case for other
                streaming services.
              </p>

                  >YouTube uses targeted advertising at the expense of user
                  privacy</b
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Don't forget, YouTube is owned by Google, which aggregates large
                amounts of data to serve people targeted advertisements. Google
                does not respect the privacy of users, and the ads you see on
                YouTube are generally targeted to you like any other ad Google
                displays. This is not necessary, and YouTube advertising might
                be more effective if it was contextual, primarily based on the
                content of the videos alongside which the ads are displayed.
                YouTube has chosen not to respect the privacy of its users. The
                collection and aggregation of data used to target ads is
                actively harmful to users and is all the more reason to continue
                blocking ads.
              </p>
              <p><b>YouTube has better solutions to many of its problems</b></p>
              <p>
                I believe that users are intelligent and understand that it is
                expensive for YouTube to host and distribute content, and that
                those bills need to be paid somehow. Instead of taking an
                adversarial position, YouTube should take users' concerns
                seriously and improve the quality of the ads they display. That
                means vetting ads before they're displayed to avoid NSFW content
                and obvious scams from being displayed to users. Many of the
                changes to YouTube's monetization system have been panned by
                content creators, and YouTube could show good faith by rolling
                back these changes and making it easier for small channels to
                monetize their content. YouTube could eliminate targeted
                advertising, automatically classify the content of videos, and
                only display contextual advertising. They could also offer
                intermediate options between being bombarded with massive
                amounts of ads and paying $13.99/month to remove all ads. For
                example, a cheaper plan could be offered to eliminate all
                mid-roll advertising, allowing some ads to remain while being
                much less obvious to users.

                    A pressing issue in Europe and the UK is the absence of

                    Only two of the most prevalent PFAS variants, PFOA and PFOS,
                    are currently monitored in the UK.

                    consider their work to be socially useless. Various
                    explanations have been proposed for the phenomenon. The
                    much-discussed "bullshit jobs theory" by the American
                    anthropologist David Graeber, for example, states that some
                    jobs are objectively useless and that this occurs more
                    frequently in certain occupations than others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other researchers suggested that the reason people felt
                    their jobs were useless was solely because they were routine
                    and lacked autonomy or good management rather than anything
                    intrinsic to their work. However, this is only one part of
                    the story, as a recent study by sociologist Simon Walo of
                    the University of Zurich shows. It is the first to give
                    quantitative support to the relevance of the occupations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The original evidence presented by Graeber was mainly
                    qualitative, which made it difficult to assess the magnitude
                    of the problem," says Walo. "This study extends previous
                    analyses by drawing on a rich, under-utilised dataset and
                    provides new evidence. This paper is therefore the first to
                    find quantitative evidence supporting the argument that the
                    occupation can be decisive for the perceived pointlessness."
                    Walo also found that the share of workers who consider their
                    jobs socially useless is higher in the private sector than
                    in the non-profit or the public sector.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, Walo's study also confirms other factors that
                    influence employees' perceptions of their own work,
                    including, e.g., alienation, unfavorable working conditions
                    and social interaction. "Employees' assessment of whether
                    their work is perceived as socially useless is a very
                    complex issue that needs to be approached from different
                    angles," the author therefore concludes. "It depends on
                    various factors that do not necessarily have anything to do
                    with the actual usefulness of work as claimed by Graeber.
                    For example, people may also view their work as socially
                    useless because unfavorable working conditions make it seem
                    pointless."

                    Vizio has been shifting its business toward advertising for
                    the past few years. Its Q2 2023 earnings report showed its
                    ad business growing 28 percent compared to the same period
                    in 2022, versus a 15 percent increase for the device
                    business. The device business was still larger that quarter
                    ($252.1 million compared to $142.3 million), but it's clear
                    that the company is eyeing advertising as the way forward.

                    [...] TV giant LG is also moving that way, CEO William Cho
                    announced in July. In a press release that month, LG said it
                    "intends to transform its TV business portfolio into a
                    'media and entertainment service provider' by expanding
                    content, services, and advertisement in products."

                  <p>
                    And then there's Telly—the upcoming TV that has a second
                    screen geared toward showing advertisements, including if
                    the TV is turned off. The screen can also show other
                    content, like sports scores or the weather, but its primary
                    gimmick is that the device is given away for free. The cost,
                    instead, comes from a wealth of mandatory data collection
                    used for selling advertisements and products.

                    Amazon's Fire TV ad push is reflective of many parts of the
                    TV industry. With TV makers today increasingly focused on
                    selling ads on their devices, we'll continue seeing ads
                    stuffed into TV operating systems, potentially at the cost
                    of UI and hardware improvements. TV sellers, similar to the
                    streaming companies whose apps those TVs serve up, have
                    grown increasingly focused on pleasing advertisers and
                    investors with continuous growth and recurring revenue
                    sources. While those parties may smile, customers are left
                    stomaching more ads on TVs that are collecting more data on
                    them.

                    The groundbreaking Intel 386 processor (1985) was the first
                    32-bit processor in the x86 line. It has numerous internal
                    registers: general-purpose registers, index registers,
                    segment selectors, and more specialized registers. In this
                    blog post, I look at the silicon die of the 386 and explain
                    how some of these registers are implemented at the
                    transistor level. The registers that I examined are
                    implemented as static RAM, with each bit stored in a common
                    8-transistor circuit, known as "8T". Studying this circuit
                    shows the interesting layout techniques that Intel used to
                    squeeze two storage cells together to minimize the space
                    they require.

                    The global movement of the seas through tidal streams and
                    ocean currents generates a rich supply of energy that may be
                    transformed into a dependable and local renewable energy
                    source.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Aiming to further this mission, Swedish firm Minesto has now
                    completed onshore testing on its 1.2 MW Dragon 12 tidal
                    energy kite system. The system will be directly transferred
                    to the Faroe Islands in Denmark for installation and
                    commissioning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to the firm, its kite system technology is a
                    lightweight, flexible, and scalable solution to harvest
                    tidal energy, which unlocks a predictable renewable energy
                    resource.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The firm's power plant comprises a wing that houses a
                    <a
                      href="https://interestingengineering.com/culture/us-nuclear-launch-sites-threatened-wind-turbines"
                      >turbine</a
                    >
                    directly connected to a generator in a nacelle. The control
                    system directs the kite's trajectory by manipulating the
                    rudders and elevators at the back of the kite. The tether
                    holds the tether as well as communication and power lines.
                    The tether is attached to the seabed foundation via a simple
                    connection that is locked and unlatched for installation and
                    retrieval.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The kite is moved by the wing's utilization of the
                    hydrodynamic lift force provided by the underwater stream.
                    An onboard control system autonomously controls the kite in
                    a predefined figure-of-eight trajectory, dragging the
                    turbine through the water at a water flow several times
                    greater than the stream speed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The turbine shaft drives the generator, sending power to the
                    grid via a cable in the tether and a seabed umbilical to the
                    coast. According to Minesto, the subsea kite is intended to
                    fly in the opposite direction of the main flow, attaining a
                    relative speed several times that of the current rate.
                    Compared to a stationary turbine, this speed increase
                    minimizes the size of the kite and rotor necessary to
                    capture energy. As a result, it is inexpensive to install,
                    run, and maintain.

                    14,000 and 16,000 years ago and moved south into Central and

                    NuScale Power and the Utah Associated Municipal Power
                    Systems announced Wednesday that they've agreed to terminate
                    the small modular reactor Carbon Free Power Project, or
                    CFPP.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Despite significant efforts by both parties to advance the
                    CFPP, it appears unlikely that the project will have enough
                    subscription to continue toward deployment. Therefore, UAMPS
                    and NuScale have mutually determined that ending the project
                    is the most prudent decision for both parties," NuScale and
                    UAMPS said in a press release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The project, which was expected to be the first
                    commercial SMR in the U.S. faced rising costs. In January,
                    NuScale raised the target price for power from the SMR to
                    $89/MWh from $58/MWh, citing a "changing financial landscape
                    for the development of energy projects nationwide."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite the termination of the CFPP, NuScale President and
                    Chief Executive Officer John Hopkins said Wednesday during
                    NuScale's Q3 earnings call that the company is focused on
                    deploying its SMR modules and is "poised to expand into new
                    markets, applications and capabilities." Hopkins highlighted
                    a number of other partnerships and projects, including plans
                    to develop two NuScale VOYGR-12 power plants that will have
                    a combined capacity of nearly 2 GW and power nearby data
                    centers in Ohio and Pennsylvania.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Though there are risks to any project, the CFPP presented
                    unique challenges that NuScale does not expect will be
                    replicated with other customers," Diane Hughes, vice
                    president of marketing and communications at NuScale, said
                    in a statement to Utility Dive.

                    Industry groups expressed disappointment but understanding
                    of the decision.

                    Personal information that corporations collect from our
                    online behaviors sells for astonishing profits and
                    incentivizes online actors to collect as much as possible.
                    Every mouse click and screen swipe can be tracked and then
                    sold to ad-tech companies and the data brokers that service
                    them.

                  <p>
                    In an attempt to justify this pervasive surveillance
                    ecosystem, corporations often claim to de-identify our data.
                    This supposedly removes all personal information (such as a
                    person's name) from the data point (such as the fact that an
                    unnamed person bought a particular medicine at a particular
                    time and place). Personal data can also be aggregated,
                    whereby data about multiple people is combined with the
                    intention of removing personal identifying information and
                    thereby protecting user privacy.
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    However, in practice, any attempt at de-identification
                    requires removal not only of your identifiable information,
                    but also of information that can identify you when
                    considered in combination with other information known about
                    you. Here's an example:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      First, think about the number of people that share your
                      specific ZIP or postal code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Next, think about how many of those people also share your
                      birthday.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Now, think about how many people share your exact
                      birthday, ZIP code, and gender.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    According to one landmark study, these three characteristics
                    are enough to uniquely identify 87% of the U.S. population.
                    A different study showed that 63% of the U.S. population can
                    be uniquely identified from these three facts.

                    We cannot trust corporations to self-regulate. The financial
                    benefit and business usefulness of our personal data often
                    outweighs our privacy and anonymity. In re-obtaining the
                    real identity of the person involved (direct identifier)
                    alongside a person's preferences (indirect identifier),
                    corporations are able to continue profiting from our most
                    sensitive information. For instance, a website that asks
                    supposedly "anonymous" users for seemingly trivial
                    information about themselves may be able to use that
                    information to make a unique profile for an individual.

                    The US Commerce Department has promised to stop promoting
                    American-made commercial spyware to foreign governments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a letter sent to US Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), the federal
                    government dept finally provided details about the policies
                    adopted by its International Trade Administration (ITA)
                    intended to prevent any further promotion of US surveillance
                    technology overseas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "For the first time the department is making clear that the
                    United States will not help companies find foreign markets
                    for products or services that undermine democracy or enable
                    repressive surveillance and discrimination," Wyden said in a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-successfully-presses-the-international-trade-administration-to-prevent-the-promotion-of-surveillance-technology-to-foreign-governments"
                      >statement</a
                    >. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ITA, which is part of the Commerce Department, promotes
                    American goods and services abroad. In May, Wyden sent a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/26/wyden_ita_spyware_policy/"
                      >letter</a
                    >
                    to US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo demanding answers
                    about its pushing of commercial spyware overseas. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Last year, the ITA confirmed to Senator Wyden that it
                    has encouraged foreign governments to buy this type of tech,
                    but it refused to answer the senator's questions about which
                    products it endorsed and in which markets. The Department of
                    Commerce still seems to be stonewalling on both, but more on
                    that later.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Promoting the use of surveillance tech and spyware
                    under the guise of 'advocating for US businesses' smacks
                    uncomfortably of eroding global human rights for a profit,"
                    Schroeder said. "The very nature of the technology makes it
                    impossible to promote use of spyware in a way that does not
                    threaten human rights values." 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While a review process is "helpful," the US has no business
                    exporting things like spyware and facial recognition tech,
                    and others, including advanced data analytics and automated
                    license plate readers, should be added to the list, she
                    said. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We've repeatedly seen this technology abused and, once
                    exported, the ITA and the US as a whole has very little
                    control over whether it will be abused or fall into the
                    hands of repressive regimes," Schroeder said.

                    Imagine a skin cream that heals damage occurring throughout
                    the day when your skin is exposed to sunlight or
                    environmental toxins. That's the potential of a synthetic,
                    biomimetic melanin developed by scientists at Northwestern
                    University.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a new study, the scientists show that their synthetic
                    melanin, mimicking the natural melanin in human skin, can be
                    applied topically to injured skin, where it accelerates
                    wound healing. These effects occur both in the skin itself
                    and systemically in the body.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When applied in a cream, the synthetic melanin can protect
                    skin from sun exposure and heals skin injured by sun damage
                    or chemical burns, the scientists said. The technology works
                    by scavenging free radicals, which are produced by injured
                    skin such as a sunburn. Left unchecked, free radical
                    activity damages cells and ultimately may result in skin
                    aging and skin cancer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study, titled "Topical Application of Synthetic Melanin
                    Promotes Tissue Repair," is published Nov. 2 in
                    <em>npj Regenerative Medicine</em>.

                    Melanin in humans and animals provides pigmentation to the
                    skin, eyes and hair. The substance protects your cells from
                    sun damage with increased pigmentation in response to
                    sunlight—a process commonly referred to as tanning. That
                    same pigment in your skin also naturally scavenges free
                    radicals in response to damaging environmental pollution
                    from industrial sources and automobile exhaust fumes.

                    New research shows that a person's own behavior is the
                    primary driver of how they treat others during brief,
                    zero-sum-game competitions. Generous people tend to reward
                    generous behavior and selfish individuals often punish
                    generosity and reward selfishness – even when it costs them
                    personally. The study found that an individual's own
                    generous or selfish deeds carry more weight than the
                    attitudes and behaviors of others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Previous research into this arena of human behavior
                    suggested that social norms are the primary factor guiding a
                    person's decision-making in competitive scenarios, said Paul
                    Bogdan, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Illinois
                    Urbana-Champaign who led the research in the Beckman
                    Institute for Advanced Science and Technology with U. of I.
                    psychology professors Florin Dolcos and Sanda Dolcos.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The prevailing view before this study was that individuals
                    form expectations based on what they view as typical. If
                    everyone around me is selfish, then I'm going to learn to
                    accept selfishness and behave accordingly," Bogdan said.
                    "But we show that your judgments of other people's behavior
                    really depend on how you behave yourself."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Cultural norms toward self-interest or generosity do
                    influence people, as other studies have found, Florin Dolcos
                    said. "But we are not only observers. This study is showing
                    that we filter information about the world through our own
                    view."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those individuals whose behavior switched from generous to
                    selfish over time were more likely to punish generosity and
                    reward selfishness – but only after their own behavior
                    changed, the team found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This helps explain the phenomenon of social alignment, for
                    better and for worse, Florin Dolcos said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "You may have groups of selfish people who are more
                    accepting of other selfish people, and in order to be part
                    of that group, newcomers might display the same behavior,"
                    he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, the study finds that a person's own generous or
                    selfish nature drives their behavior in many arenas of life,
                    Sanda Dolcos said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is not just about decision-making," she said. "It has
                    practical relevance to many types of social interactions and
                    social evaluations."

                Former U.S. astronaut Frank Borman has died at the age of 95,
                NASA said on Thursday.
              </p>
              <p>
                He commanded the 1968 Apollo 8 mission that carried three
                astronauts farther from Earth than anyone had ever travelled.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm old enough to remember Apollo 8 (December 21–27, 1968, the
                first crewed spacecraft to leave low Earth orbit and the first
                human spaceflight to reach the Moon. The crew orbited the Moon
                ten times without landing, and then departed safely back to
                Earth. Three astronauts—Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William
                Anders—were the first humans to witness and photograph the far
                side of the Moon and an Earthrise.
              </p>
              <p>
                Born in Gary, Indiana, on March 14, 1928, he was the oldest
                American astronaut still living; that mantle now passes to Jim
                Lovell, who is also 95 but eleven days younger.
