                    When NASA says a celestial event is noteworthy, you know it
                    should be spectacular.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's certainly the case with the Perseid meteor shower,
                    which
                    <a
                      href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/perseids/in-depth/"
                      >NASA calls</a
                    >
                    "the best meteor shower of the year," and is correspondingly
                    the "most popular meteor shower,"
                    <a
                      href="https://www.amsmeteors.org/meteor-showers/meteor-shower-calendar/#Perseids"
                      >according to the American Meteor Society</a
                    >
                    (AMS).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although the Perseid meteor shower is visible this year from
                    July 14–September 1, it is expected to peak on August 12 and
                    early on August 13. Stargazers can expect to see up to 100
                    meteors per hour traveling at 37 miles per second, NASA
                    notes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "With swift and bright meteors, Perseids frequently leave
                    long 'wakes' of light and color behind them as they streak
                    through Earth's atmosphere," NASA explains. "Perseids are
                    also known for their fireballs, which are larger explosions
                    of light and color that can persist longer than an average
                    meteor streak."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Comets, which originate far outside the orbit of the
                    outermost planets, have elliptical orbits around the Sun.
                    For perspective, since they can be miles in diameter,
                    <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/comets">NASA notes</a> that
                    they are about the "size of a small town."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Comets are essentially a giant "dirty snowball" made of
                    frozen gasses with embedded rock and dust particles, NASA
                    continues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As comets near the Sun during their orbit, they warm,
                    freeing bits of rock and dust that are then left behind in
                    what can be thought of as a trail of debris. Every year,
                    when Earth passes through these trails of rock and dust on
                    its own orbit around the Sun, the debris particles collide
                    with Earth's atmosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When this happens, the particles heat up to temperatures of
                    around 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, creating streaks across the
                    sky,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.space.com/3113-meteors-meteor-showers-science.html"
                      >Space.com explains</a
                    >. Those streaks, or shooting stars, stop abruptly when the
                    intense heat evaporates most meteors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fragments of space debris that collide with Earth's
                    atmosphere to create the Perseid meteor shower each summer
                    were left in the wake of a comet named 109P/Swift-Tuttle.
                    The comet has a unique name because it was discovered in
                    1862 independently by both Lewis Swift and Horace Tuttle,
                    NASA explains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Swift-Tuttle is a large comet with a nucleus that is 16
                    miles wide. Amazingly, it takes 133 years for it to orbit
                    the Sun.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although meteor showers are caused by comet debris colliding
                    with Earth's atmosphere, they are named for their radiant —
                    where they appear to come from in the night sky.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Perseid meteor shower gets its name because its meteors
                    appear to come from the constellation Perseus, named for the
                    famed Greek hero. Perseus not only slew Medusa the Gorgon
                    who had snakes as hair, he also rescued his future wife
                    Andromeda from a sea monster sent by Poseidon to destroy the
                    coast and land of Ethiopia.

                    In a couple of days, I pack up my bags to head for DEFCON.
                    In a rare moment of pre-planning, perhaps spurred by
                    boredom, I looked through the schedule to see what's in
                    store in the world of telephony. There is a workshop on SS7,
                    of course [1], plenty of content on cellular, but as far as
                    I see nothing on the biggest topic in telecom security:
                    STIR/SHAKEN.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I can venture a guess as to why: STIR/SHAKEN is boring. So
                    here we go!
                  </p>
                  <p>The Nature of Circuit Switching</p>
                  <p>
                    Understanding today's robocalling problem requires starting
                    a long time ago. Taking you all the way back to the
                    invention of the telephone would be a little gratuitous, but
                    it is useful to start our discussion with the introduction
                    of direct distance dialing in 1951. In that year, the first
                    long-distance call was completed based only on the customer
                    dialing a number. Over the following decades direct distance
                    dialing became more common and fewer telephone users had to
                    speak to an operator to have a long-distance call
                    established. Today, it's universal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Handling dial calls over long distance trunks is a bit
                    complicated, though. For local calls, handling was
                    relatively simple. The other customer was connected to the
                    same exchange that you were, so the exchange just needed to
                    be able to detect your dialing and select the correct local
                    loop corresponding to the number you dialed. Step-by-step
                    (SxS) switches have been handling this problem since the
                    turn of the 20th century. For long distance calls, though,
                    the recipient will not be on the same switch---they'll be on
                    a foreign exchange.

                When things don't work out for scooter rental companies and they
                shut down or pull out of a city, they usually take spare stock
                with them. However, when Spin backed out of Seattle, many locals
                discovered unused scooters scattered throughout the city. Upon
                closer inspection of these abandoned devices, or should we say
                dissection, it was uncovered that they each have a Raspberry Pi
                4B inside.
              </p>
              <p>
                This discovery was recently shared on social media. Legally, if
                the scooters are abandoned then snagging one for the Pi inside
                is fair game but it's not clear if Spin has plans to recover
                their remaining assets.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Seattle city government official website confirm that Spin
                originally arrived in 2021 as a fourth scooter rental option.
                However, the company did not renew its license for the most
                recent cycle. Because of this, you can find a few remaining Spin
                scooters around the city.

                  <p>
                    The math trick in question is known as the

                    For simplicity's sake, our GNSS technology uses a rough
                    estimate of Earth's squashed ball shape. If we're to develop
                    a Geographic Information System (GIS) for the lunar surface,
                    we need the same estimate for the Moon's selenoid (the

                    from 2019 granting news agencies' so-called "neighboring
                    rights." These rights were designed to reduce the "value
                    gap" between publishers and the online platforms that profit
                    off of promoting publishers' content.

                  <p>
                    AFP filed the copyright case after becoming concerned about
                    "the clear refusal" from X to "enter into discussions
                    regarding the implementation of neighboring rights for the
                    press," the AFP press release said. During discussions, AFP
                    said that X was expected to share data that would help the
                    news agency calculate how much money X owed for profiting
                    off of AFP's news content.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now AFP is seeking an "urgent injunction" ordering X to
                    "provide all the necessary elements required for assessing
                    the remuneration owed to AFP under the neighboring rights
                    legislation."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    X and AFP did not immediately respond to Ars' request to
                    comment.

                    community-driven approach to its development.

                    He was the first to coin the term "charityware." Although
                    users may use and copy Vim for free, they are encouraged to
                    donate to the International Child Care Fund Holland to help
                    children in Uganda.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I have never wanted to make money from Vim," said Moolenaar
                    in an interview last year. "It started as a hobby and most
                    of the time I had a job that paid well enough."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Donations amount to around €30,000 per year — enough to help
                    about 50 children finish their education, from primary
                    school to university.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While he might have logged off from this world for
                    good, Moolenaar's legacy and Vim — a text editor that
                    continues to empower developers across the globe — lives on.

                In 1965, Popular Hot Rodding magazine bought a $250 '57 Chevy
                for a test bed, to try out various drag racing parts and tuning
                techniques. It was called Project X back then, here's a capsule

                    small-blocks, big-blocks, mechanical fuel Injection,
                    multibarrel carbs, cross-ram manifolds, superchargers, and
                    even electronic fuel injection. The Project X 1957 Chevy has
                    had it all over the decades. It was a car constantly
                    reinventing itself to keep up with the latest trends in hot

                Along the way it also appeared in the movie Hollywood Knights
                and has become arguably the most famous '57 Chevy ever. Nearly
                20 years ago it want back to GM for a "makeover" including a
                modified Corvette front suspension, and since then it picked up
                another nickname, the "Million-Dollar Chevy."

                    At this point our best 60-foot time was a solid 1.54
                    seconds. We were really happy with that time but at around
                    100 feet the system was dropping the voltage and killing our
                    ET. The engineers kept working on the issue and eventually
                    the car was waking up again around the 570-foot mark, but
                    that loss in the middle was still hurting our overall time.
                    The best analogy is an EFI car with fuel-control issues, but
                    instead of running out of fuel, we were losing electricity
                    flow.

                    The MBR solar park's research and development unit is
                    already exploring practical solar innovations to integrate
                    into Dubai's metropolitan environment and reduce energy
                    costs.

                    leaves in addition to solar-powered street lamps and

                    The MBR Solar Park claims many world records with its
                    projects, including the construction of what will be the
                    world's tallest concentrated solar power (CSP) tower.

                  <p>
                    The solar spire stands at about 260 metres high, which is
                    roughly 60 metres short of Paris' Eiffel Tower.

                    It will use around 70,000 heliostats like mirrors to magnify
                    the sun's rays into thermal energy and store it for about 15
                    hours - able to provide electricity around the clock,
                    solving a major issue with renewable technology.

                    The installation is part of the project's fourth phase,
                    which plans to double its energy production upon completion.

                    the UAE is using such investment to build a combination of
                    solar, nuclear, and other renewable energy sources, which

                    "The mantra is decarbonization, decentralization, and
                    digitalization," says Ramaswamy, who forecasts that the
                    final stage will incorporate big data, artificial
                    intelligence, and blockchain into the mix to coordinate the
                    new normal of powering cities.

                A team of paleontologists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
                working with colleagues from Xi'an Jiaotong University, the
                University of York, the University of Chinese Academy of
                Sciences and the National Research Center on Human Evolution,
                has found evidence of a previously unknown human lineage. In
                their study, reported in Journal of Human Evolution, the group
                analyzed the fossilized jawbone, partial skull and some leg
                bones of a hominin dated to 300,000 years ago.
              </p>
              <p>
                The fossils were excavated at a site in Hualongdong, in what is
                now a part of East China. They were subsequently subjected to
                both a morphological and a geometric assessment, with the
                initial focus on the jawbone, which exhibited unique features—a
                triangular lower edge and a unique bend.

                  <p>
                    In a world first, a quadriplegic man in the United States
                    has regained touch and movement after surgeons successfully
                    implanted microchips into his brain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AI is then used to read, interpret and translate his
                    thoughts into action.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Keith Thomas, 45, broke his neck in an accident and became
                    paralysed from his chest down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A team of medical professionals first spent months
                    mapping Thomas' brain using MRIs to help pinpoint the areas
                    responsible for both arm movement and the sensation of touch
                    in his hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>He then underwent a 15-hour open-brain surgery.</p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Dr Ashesh Mehta, the surgeon who performed Thomas'
                    brain surgery said the wiring in Thomas' brain was "broken".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "What we did was a bypass, so we bypassed the block.
                    So, we're basically using a computer to read Keith's
                    thoughts and then translate that into a machine that then
                    stimulates his hand so that he can move it," explained
                    Mehta.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The procedure - dubbed as a "double neural bypass" - goes
                    the other direction as well. He can now "feel" something
                    through tiny electrodes instead of neurons responsible for
                    feeling his fingertips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The tiny sensors at his fingertips and palm send touch and
                    pressure information back to the sensory area of his brain
                    implant to restore sensation through a computer instead of
                    through the normal pathway through the spinal cord.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's almost like fooling the nervous system to make it
                    work," said Mehta.

                    in court. Lichtenstein has admitted that he used multiple
                    advanced hacking tools and techniques to gain entry into the
                    cryptocurrency exchange's network. He then authorized 2,000
                    transactions to move 119,754 bitcoins to wallets he
                    controlled. To cover his tracks, he said he deleted access
                    credentials, logs and other digital breadcrumbs that could
                    give him away. Morgan, his wife, helped him move and launder
                    the stolen funds.

                  <p>
                    If you'll recall, the Justice Department seized 95,000 of
                    the stolen bitcoins at the time of their arrest. Back then,
                    that digital coin hoard was worth a whopping $3.6 billion
                    and was the largest financial seizure in the agency's
                    history. Authorities were able to trace more of the stolen
                    funds after that to recover an additional $475 million worth
                    of cryptocurrency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the DOJ, Lichtenstein and Morgan used false
                    identities to set up online accounts on darknet markets and
                    cryptocurrency exchanges. They then withdrew the funds and
                    distributed the bitcoins from there by converting them into
                    other forms of cryptocurrency and keeping them in crypto
                    mixing services. By doing so, they obfuscated the coins'
                    sources and made them harder to trace.

                    couldn't find "tank man" at the time because the service

                    "We are not the evil outsider, but we're actually the
                    insider, we own the car," researcher and TU Berlin Ph.D.
                    candidate Christian Werling told TechCrunch. "And we don't
                    want to pay these $300 for the rear heated seats."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Specifically, he and his colleagues used a technique called
                    voltage glitching or a voltage fault injection attack to
                    disrupt the AMD processor that powers the car's Tesla
                    Infotainment System and get it to do their bidding. "If we
                    do it at the right moment, we can trick the CPU into doing
                    something else," Welling added. "It has a hiccup, skips an
                    instruction, and accepts our manipulated code. That's
                    basically what we do in a nutshell."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the report, this new exploit could also enable
                    hackers to activate the $15,000 self-driving feature in
                    regions where it's locked out, though the researchers
                    haven't tried that themselves yet. But since the
                    vulnerability — while affecting software capabilities — is
                    hardware-based, Tesla can't patch it, with the researchers
                    telling TechCrunch that a fix would require replacing the
                    affected hardware. Tesla did not respond to TechCrunch's
                    request for comment on the exploit.

                    With more than two million visitors flocking to Japan last
                    month in the wake of the country's post-pandemic reopening,
                    railway companies are gearing up to warmly greet the influx
                    of global travellers.

                    Seibu Railway, one of the country's large railroad
                    companies, is implementing a new simultaneous translation
                    system to help foreign tourists navigate Tokyo's metro which
                    is notorious for its complexity.

                    [...] this new semi-transparent display has translations pop

                    "The display we have introduced can automatically translate
                    between Japanese and other languages. When customers speak
                    in a foreign language, the station attendant can see it in
                    Japanese, and when the station attendant speaks Japanese,
                    customers can read the sentences in their own language,"
                    said Ayano Yajima, Seibu Railway Sales and Marketing
                    supervisor.

                    everything out, showing it and (there being)
                    misunderstandings. Having it like this, clear on the screen,
                    it's really nice," said Kevin Cometto, an Italian student
                    visiting Japan.

                  <p>
                    But with the translation window, a face-to-face conversation
                    through the screen is possible, complete with facial

                    customers with more complex requests such as seeking
                    directions or information about the local area.

                    Elon Musk's tunneling company has permission to
                    significantly expand its operations under the city of Las
                    Vegas. Last month, the Las Vegas City Council voted
                    unanimously to approve the Boring Company's plan to dig more
                    tunnels under the city, following in the steps of Clark
                    County,

                    to the tunneling concern. The company's plan calls for 68
                    miles of tunnels and 81 stations, served by a fleet of Tesla
                    electric vehicles, each able to carry three passengers at a
                    time.

                    said yes to a $48.6 million, 2.2-mile loop underneath the
                    convention center. In 2021, the LVCC Loop opened a 1.7-mile
                    network with three stations; the Boring Company claims it
                    has transported 1.15 million passengers, with a peak
                    capacity of just 4,500 people per hour. For context, a
                    subway system can be expected to carry between 600 and 1,000
                    people per train.

                    If you know anything about this subject, you've probably
                    heard that LLMs are trained to "predict the next word" and
                    that they require huge amounts of text to do this. But that
                    tends to be where the explanation stops. The details of how
                    they predict the next word is often treated as a deep
                    mystery.<br />[...]<br />To understand how language models
                    work, you first need to understand how they represent words.
                    Humans represent English words with a sequence of letters,
                    like C-A-T for "cat." Language models use a long list of
                    numbers called a "word vector." For example,
                    <a
                      href="http://vectors.nlpl.eu/explore/embeddings/en/MOD_enwiki_upos_skipgram_300_2_2021/cat_NOUN/"

                    >
                    to represent cat as a vector:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [0.0074, 0.0030, -0.0105, 0.0742, 0.0765, -0.0011, 0.0265,

                    -0.0563, -0.0396, -0.0998, -0.0796, ..., 0.0002]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (The full vector is 300 numbers long—to see it all,

                    and then click "show the raw vector.")

                  <p>
                    Why use such a baroque notation? Here's an analogy.
                    Washington, DC, is located at 38.9 degrees north and 77
                    degrees west. We can represent this using a vector notation:

                    advantage of representing words with vectors of real numbers
                    (as opposed to a string of letters, like C-A-T) is that
                    numbers enable operations that letters don't.

                    Words are too complex to represent in only two dimensions,
                    so language models use vector spaces with hundreds or even
                    thousands of dimensions.<br />[...]<br />Researchers have
                    been experimenting with word vectors for decades, but the
                    concept really took off when Google
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781"
                      >announced its word2vec project</a
                    >
                    in 2013. Google analyzed millions of documents harvested
                    from Google News to figure out which words tend to appear in
                    similar sentences. Over time, a neural network trained to
                    predict which words co-occur with other words learned to
                    place similar words (like dog and cat) close together in
                    vector space.<br />[...]<br />Because these vectors are
                    built from the way humans use words, they end up reflecting
                    many of the

                    >. For example, in some word vector models, "doctor minus
                    man plus woman" yields "nurse." Mitigating biases like this
                    is an area of active research.<br />[...]<br />Traditional
                    software is designed to operate on data that's unambiguous.
                    If you ask a computer to compute "2 + 3," there's no
                    ambiguity about what 2, +, or 3 mean. But natural language
                    is full of ambiguities that go beyond homonyms and polysemy:

                      "his" refer to the customer or the mechanic?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In "the professor urged the student to do her homework"
                      does "her" refer to the professor or the student?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In "fruit flies like a banana" is "flies" a verb
                      (referring to fruit soaring across the sky) or a noun
                      (referring to banana-loving insects)?
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    People resolve ambiguities like this based on context, but
                    there are no simple or deterministic rules for doing this.
                    Rather, it requires understanding facts about the world. You
                    need to know that mechanics typically fix customers' cars,
                    that students typically do their own homework, and that
                    fruit typically doesn't fly.

                    Word vectors provide a flexible way for language models to

                    that the first few layers focus on understanding the
                    sentence's syntax and resolving ambiguities like we've shown
                    above. Later layers (which we're not showing to keep the
                    diagram a manageable size) work to develop a high-level
                    understanding of the passage as a whole.<br />[...]<br />In
                    short, these nine attention heads enabled GPT-2 to figure
                    out that "John gave a drink to John" doesn't make sense and
                    choose "John gave a drink to Mary" instead.

                    We love this example because it illustrates just how
                    difficult it will be to fully understand LLMs. The
                    five-member Redwood team published a
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593">25-page paper</a>
                    explaining how they identified and validated these attention
                    heads. Yet even after they did all that work, we are still
                    far from having a comprehensive explanation for why GPT-2
                    decided to predict "Mary" as the next word.<br />[...]<br />In
                    a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14913">2020 paper</a>,
                    researchers from Tel Aviv University found that feed-forward
                    layers work by pattern matching: Each neuron in the hidden
                    layer matches a specific pattern in the input text.<br />[...]<br />Recent

                    revealed an elegant example of how feed-forward layers help
                    to predict the next word. Earlier, we discussed Google's
                    word2vec research showing it was possible to use vector
                    arithmetic to reason by analogy. For example, Berlin -
                    Germany + France = Paris.

                    The Brown researchers found that feed-forward layers
                    sometimes use this exact method to predict the next word.<br />[...]<br />All
                    the parts of LLMs we've discussed in this article so far—the
                    neurons in the feed-forward layers and the attention heads
                    that move contextual information between words—are
                    implemented as a chain of simple mathematical functions

                    five years, OpenAI has steadily increased the size of its
                    language models. In a
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf"
                      >widely read 2020 paper</a
                    >, OpenAI reported that the accuracy of its language models
                    scaled "as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and
                    the amount of compute used for training, with some trends
                    spanning more than seven orders of magnitude."

                    The larger their models got, the better they were at tasks
                    involving language. But this was only true if they increased
                    the amount of training data by a similar factor. And to
                    train larger models on more data, you need a lot more
                    computing power.<br />[...]<br />Psychologists call this
                    capacity to reason about the mental states of other people
                    "theory of mind." Most people have this capacity from the
                    time they're in grade school.

                    quoted above and then asked them to complete a sentence like
                    "she believes that the bag is full of." The correct answer
                    is "chocolate," but an unsophisticated language model might
                    say "popcorn" or something else.<br />[...]<br />It's worth
                    noting that researchers don't all agree that these results

                    arguing that GPT-4 showed early, tantalizing hints of
                    artificial general intelligence—the ability to think in a
                    sophisticated, human-like way.

                  <p>
                    For example, one researcher asked GPT-4 to draw a unicorn
                    using an obscure graphics programming language called TiKZ.
                    GPT-4 responded with a few lines of code that the researcher
                    then fed into the TiKZ software. The resulting images were
                    crude, but they showed clear signs that GPT-4 had some
                    understanding of what unicorns look like.<br />[...]<br />At
                    the moment, we don't have any real insight into how LLMs
                    accomplish feats like this. Some people argue that such
                    examples demonstrate that the models are starting to truly
                    understand the meanings of the words in their training set.

                    without truly understanding them.<br />[...]<br />Further,
                    prediction may be foundational to biological intelligence as
                    well as artificial intelligence.

                    environment that can then be used to navigate that
                    environment successfully.<br />[...]<br />Traditionally, a
                    major challenge for building language models was figuring
                    out the most useful way of representing different
                    words—especially because the meanings of many words depend
                    heavily on context. The next-word prediction approach allows
                    researchers to sidestep this thorny theoretical puzzle by
                    turning it into an empirical problem. It turns out that if
                    we provide enough data and computing power, language models
                    end up learning a lot about how human language works simply
                    by figuring out how to best predict the next word. The
                    downside is that we wind up with systems whose inner
                    workings we don't fully understand.

                    While 21st century water companies struggle to maintain
                    clean, fresh supplies, new research from an international
                    team led by Oxford geoarchaeologist Dr. Güel Sürmelihindi,
                    reveals that, some 2,000 years ago, Roman water engineers
                    were keeping up a regular program of managing and
                    maintaining the ancient water systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the research, published in
                    <em>Scientific Reports,</em> ancient water management traces
                    are captured in the limescale deposits which built up on the
                    walls and floor of the ancient Roman aqueduct of Divona
                    (Cahors, France).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The evidence shows that these deposits were regularly and
                    partially removed during maintenance. It reveals, "The
                    discovery of traces of regular maintenance in the carbonate
                    deposits... such as tool marks, calcite deformation twins,
                    debris from cleaning and repairs...are proof of periodic
                    manual carbonate removal by Roman maintenance teams.

                    Once, many years ago, I stayed on the 62nd floor of the
                    Westin Peachtree Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia. This was in the
                    age when the price of a hotel room was directly correlated
                    with the price of the WiFi service, and as a high school
                    student I was not prepared to pay in excess of $15 a day for
                    the internet. As I remember, a Motel 6 that was not blocks
                    away but within line of sight ended up filling the role. But
                    even up there, 62 floors from the ground, there was false
                    promise: Free Public WiFi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I am not the first person to write on this phenomenon, I
                    think I originally came to understand it as a result of a
                    2010 segment of All Things Considered. For a period of a few
                    years, almost everywhere you went, there was a WiFi network
                    called "Free Public WiFi." While it was both free and public
                    in the most literal sense, it did not offer internet access.
                    It was totally useless, and fell somewhere between a joke, a
                    scam, and an accident of history. Since I'm not the first to
                    write about it, I have to be the most thorough, and so let's
                    start out with a discussion of WiFi itself.

                    The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has taken an
                    astonishing new image of the Ring Nebula. This glowing,

                    The Ring Nebula is about 2600 light years away in the

                    call a planetary nebula, which forms when

                    Yoran has more to add to the senator’s arguments, writing in
                    his post that Microsoft has demonstrated a “repeated pattern
                    of negligent cybersecurity practices,” enabling Chinese
                    hackers to spy on the US government. He also revealed

                    in Microsoft Azure and says the company took too long to
                    address it.

                  <p>
                    Tenable initially discovered the flaw in March and found
                    that it could give bad actors access to a company’s
                    sensitive data, including a bank. Yoran claims Microsoft
                    took “more than 90 days to implement a partial fix” after
                    Tenable notified the company, adding that the fix only
                    applies to “new applications loaded in the service.”
                    According to Yoran, the bank and all the other organizations
                    “that had launched the service prior to the fix” are still
                    affected by the flaw — and are likely unaware of that risk.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yoran says Microsoft plans to fix the issue by the end of
                    September but calls the delayed response “grossly
                    irresponsible, if not blatantly negligent.” He also points
                    to data from Google’s Project Zero, which indicates that
                    Microsoft products have made up 42.5 percent of all
                    discovered zero-day vulnerabilities since 2014.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “What you hear from Microsoft is ‘just trust us,’ but what
                    you get back is very little transparency and a culture of
                    toxic obfuscation,” Yoran writes. “How can a CISO, board of
                    directors or executive team believe that Microsoft will do
                    the right thing given the fact patterns and current
                    behaviors?”

                    the previous record holder – Rising Eagle and JSquared
                    Telecom – by nearly $75 million in 2020. After a lengthy
                    investigation, the Commission decided on Thursday to proceed
                    with the huge fine.

                    The record-breaking punishment goes to an illegal
                    transnational robocalling operation. The outfit is so big
                    (or so blatantly illegal) that it does not have an official
                    umbrella company. It's more of a network of cooperating
                    businesses that made more than five billion automated calls
                    to over 500 million phone numbers within a three-month
                    period in 2021.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In doing so, the FCC says the organized operation broke
                    multiple federal laws by spoofing more than one million
                    telephone numbers to hide their actual origin and trick
                    people into answering the calls. It also violated numerous
                    other FCC regulations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The operation has allegedly been around since 2018 and
                    primarily sold consumers vehicle service contracts falsely
                    disguised as auto warranties. Two primary bad actors – Roy
                    M. Cox and Aaron Michael Jones – already hold lifetime bans
                    from running telemarketing businesses after losing a lawsuit
                    brought on them by the FCC and the State of Texas. Business
                    names associated with the illegal enterprise include Sumco
                    Panama, Virtual Telecom, Davis Telecom, Geist Telecom, Fugle
                    Telecom, Tech Direct, Mobi Telecom, and Posting Express.

                  <p>
                    [...] It's hard to nail down robocallers, but it's at least
                    nice to see the FCC trying to hit them with huge penalties
                    instead of laughable

                    A new study has shown that humans may have evolved a
                    spring-like arch to help us walk on two feet. Researchers
                    studying the evolution of

                    walking have long assumed that the raised arch of the foot
                    helps us walk by acting as a lever which propels the body
                    forward. But a global team of scientists have now found that
                    the recoil of the flexible arch repositions the ankle
                    upright for more effective walking. The effects in running
                    are greater, which suggests that the ability to run
                    efficiently could have been a selective pressure for a
                    flexible arch that made walking more efficient too. This
                    discovery could even help doctors improve treatments for
                    present-day patients' foot problems.

                    "We thought originally that the spring-like arch helped to
                    lift the body into the next step," said Dr Lauren Welte,
                    first author of the study in

                    and is now affiliated with the University of
                    Wisconsin-Madison. "It turns out that instead, the
                    spring-like arch recoils to help the ankle lift the body."

                    give hominins more leverage when walking upright: the
                    mechanism is unclear, but when arch motion is restricted,
                    running demands more energy. Arch recoil could potentially
                    make us more efficient runners by propelling the center mass
                    of the body forward, or by making up for mechanical work
                    that muscles would otherwise have to do.

                    [...] Although the scientists expected to find that arch
                    recoil helped the rigid lever of the arch to lift the body
                    up, they discovered that a rigid arch without recoil either
                    caused the foot to leave the ground early, likely decreasing
                    the efficiency of the calf muscles, or leaned the ankle
                    bones too far forward. The forward lean mirrors the posture
                    of walking chimpanzees, rather than the upright stance
                    characteristic of human gait. The flexible arch helped
                    reposition the ankle upright, which allows the leg to push
                    off the ground more effectively. This effect is even greater
                    when running, suggesting that efficient running may have
                    been an evolutionary pressure in favor of the flexible arch.

                    [...] "The mobility of our feet seems to allow us to walk
                    and run upright instead of either crouching forward or
                    pushing off into the next step too soon," said Dr Michael
                    Rainbow of Queen's University, senior author.

                  <p>
                    These findings also suggest therapeutic avenues for people
                    whose arches are rigid due to injury or illness: supporting
                    the flexibility of the arch could improve overall mobility.

                    The update will come into effect on February 1, 2024, when
                    AWS customers will see a charge of $0.005 (half a cent) per
                    IP address per hour for all public IPv4 addresses. These
                    charges will apparently apply whether the address is
                    attached to a service or not, and like many AWS charges,
                    appear inconsequential at first glance but can mount up over
                    time if a customer is using many of them.

                    African cuckoos may have met their match with the
                    fork-tailed drongo, which scientists predict can detect and
                    reject cuckoo eggs from their nest on almost every occasion,
                    despite them on average looking almost identical to drongo
                    eggs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fork-tailed drongos, belligerent birds from sub-Saharan
                    Africa, lay eggs with a staggering diversity of colors and
                    patterns. All these colors and patterns are forged by the
                    African cuckoo.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    African cuckoos lay their eggs in drongos' nests to avoid
                    rearing their chick themselves (an example of so-called
                    brood parasitism). By forging drongo egg colors and
                    patterns, cuckoos trick drongos into thinking the cuckoo egg
                    is one of their own.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But drongos use knowledge of their own personal egg
                    "signatures"—their eggs' color and pattern –to identify
                    cuckoo egg "forgeries" and reject them from their nests, say
                    scientists. These "signatures" are like the signatures we
                    use in our daily lives: unique to each individual and highly
                    repeatable by the same individual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Through natural selection, the African cuckoo's eggs have
                    evolved to look almost-identical to drongo eggs—a rare
                    example of high-fidelity mimicry in nature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A team led by researchers at the University of Cambridge and
                    the University of Cape Town, working in collaboration with a
                    community in Zambia, set out to explore the effectiveness of
                    "signatures" as a defense against highly accurate mimicry.
                    The findings are published today in the journal,
                    <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They found that despite near-perfect mimicry of fork-tailed
                    drongo eggs, African cuckoo eggs still have a high
                    probability of being rejected.

                    Film companies lost another attempt to force Reddit to
                    identify anonymous users who discussed piracy. A federal

                    The plaintiffs are 20 producers of popular movies who are
                    trying to prove that Internet service provider Grande is
                    liable for its subscribers' copyright infringement because
                    the ISP allegedly ignores piracy on its network. Reddit
                    isn't directly involved in the copyright case. But the film
                    companies filed a motion to compel Reddit to respond to a
                    subpoena demanding "basic account information including IP
                    address registration and logs from 1/1/2016 to present,
                    name, email address and other account registration
                    information" for six users who wrote comments on Reddit
                    threads in 2011 and 2018.

                    pointed out that the statute of limitations for copyright

                    the statute of limitations is irrelevant to whether the
                    comments can provide evidence in the case against Grande.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When a court evaluates an unmasking request, it
                    considers whether a subpoena "was issued in good faith and
                    not for any improper purpose," whether "the identifying
                    information is directly and materially relevant" to a core
                    claim or defense, and whether "information sufficient to
                    establish or to disprove that claim or defense is
                    unavailable from any other source," the ruling said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The fact that Grande already provided names of 118
                    subscribers factored into Beeler's explanation of why she
                    denied the film companies' motion.

                    The ban on incandescent lightbulbs has officially gone into
                    effect in the U.S., more than a decade after the federal
                    government first passed a rule prohibiting the non-energy

                    conducted by the U.S. Energy Information Administration
                    found that less than half of U.S. households use LED
                    lightbulbs for most or all indoor lighting

                    [....] Under the new standard, lightbulbs must produce 45
                    lumens -- the measure of brightness -- per watt. For

                    goes into effect on Aug. 1, 2023, which means if they're

                    The Austin, Texas-based electric carmaker deployed the team
                    because its service centers were inundated with appointments
                    from owners who had expected better performance based on the
                    company's advertised estimates and the projections displayed
                    by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves,
                    according to several people familiar with the matter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Managers told the employees that they were saving
                    Tesla about $1,000 for every canceled appointment, the
                    people said. Another goal was to ease the pressure on
                    service centers, some of which had long waits for
                    appointments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In most cases, the complaining customers' cars likely did
                    not need repair, according to the people familiar with the
                    matter. Rather, Tesla created the groundswell of complaints
                    another way – by hyping the range of its futuristic electric
                    vehicles, or EVs, raising consumer expectations beyond what
                    the cars can deliver. Teslas often fail to achieve their
                    advertised range estimates and the projections provided by
                    the cars' own equipment, according to Reuters interviews
                    with three automotive experts who have tested or studied the
                    company's vehicles.

                    A prominent journal has decided to retract a paper by Ranga
                    Dias, a physicist at the University of Rochester in New York
                    who has made controversial claims about discovering
                    room-temperature superconductors — materials that would not
                    require any cooling to conduct electricity with zero
                    resistance. The forthcoming retraction, of a paper published
                    by Physical Review Letters (PRL) in 2021, is significant
                    because the Nature news team has learnt that it is the
                    result of an investigation that found apparent data
                    fabrication. PRL's decision follows

                electric car chargers (Tesla currently has 22,000), with both

                Then going back a month or so, we see New York power grid

                Plenty of other similar reports from electric utilities,
                including the big winter outage in Texas.

                Got popcorn? If you have electric cooking, better pop it now to
                have something to munch when the power goes out...when too many
                HVAC units (cooling/summer and heating/winter) come online at
                the same time as the battery electric cars are charging. If you
                are literally cooking with gas, then you can have fresh popcorn!

                    Medical scientists are in a race against time—increasingly,
                    bacteria are developing resistance to modern therapies,
                    leaving doctors with fewer options in treating patients with
                    infections. In this new effort, the research team looked at
                    the possibility of finding extinct molecules that might be
                    able to kill bacteria alive today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The idea behind this new research is that many organisms,
                    including humans, produce peptides with antimicrobial
                    properties. Those developed by humans are already used
                    naturally by the body. But what about extinct human
                    relatives such as Neanderthals and Denisovans? Perhaps they
                    produced peptides that might be useful against modern
                    bacteria.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The team trained an AI app to spot sites on human
                    proteins that are known to produce peptides. They used the
                    app on data from modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans
                    to find peptides from the latter two sources. They then
                    compared the properties of the peptides they found with
                    newer peptides to predict which of those in H.
                    neanderthalensis and Denisovans might be bacteria killers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next, the team synthesized the molecules they identified and
                    tested them against bacteria in a petri dish. Six of those
                    that showed promise were then used to treat mice infected
                    with Acinetobacter baumannii—a common bacteria found in
                    hospital settings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team found that all six of the peptides slowed or
                    stopped the growth of an infection but none actually killed
                    the bacteria. They also found that five of the six did kill
                    bacteria growing in skin abscesses, but that was only when
                    doses were extremely high.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers believe their approach shows promise. They
                    suggest that more research using their approach might lead
                    to more effective antibiotics.

                    A sample from the asteroid Bennu, which could be key to
                    understanding the formation of the solar system and our own
                    planet, is set to be analyzed at NASA's Johnson Space Center
                    in Houston after it reaches Earth in late September.

                    The precious cargo is currently aboard OSIRIS-REx, a US
                    space probe launched in 2016 to Bennu, which orbits the Sun
                    at an average distance of about 105 million miles (168

                    started during the Apollo missions to the Moon.

                    on September 24, carrying an estimated 8.8 ounces, or 250
                    grams of material—just over a cupful.

                    The finding lent weight to a longstanding theory that life
                    on Earth may have been seeded from outer space when
                    asteroids crashed into our planet carrying fundamental
                    elements.

                    [...] "Discovering a new type of star is pretty interesting
                    all by itself, but discovering it's dark matter that's
                    powering this—that would be huge," said Katherine Freese, an
                    astrophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin and the
                    study's co-author, in a university

                      >release</a
                    >. "If some of these objects that look like early galaxies
                    are actually dark stars, the simulations of galaxy formation
                    agree better with observations."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dark stars were first proposed in 2008, but only now is the
                    Webb Space Telescope offering clear views of some of the
                    most ancient light we can see. The theorized stars would be
                    cool, puffy, and up to ten billion times the luminosity of
                    the Sun, according to the research team.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The research team believes that dark stars could be
                    misconstrued as large galaxies, and that the stars may seed
                    the supermassive black holes seen even in the universe's
                    early days—which is to say, the first few hundred million
                    years of its existence.

                    X's are everywhere in user interface (UI) design. A powerful
                    symbol, [x] is capable of closing windows and popups,
                    toolbars and tabs and anything else that might otherwise be
                    cluttering up your screen.

                  <p>
                    Clicking on [x] to close a feature has become an instinctual
                    part of using a computer and a standard in web and software
                    design. Although it may seem like the ubiquitous [x] has
                    always been a part of Graphical User Interfaces (GUI), a
                    quick jaunt through the history of GUIs reveals that this
                    actually isn't the case.

                  <p>
                    So where and when did the [x] first enter into the UI
                    lexicon?

                    from Mastodon founder and CEO Eugen Rochko, the number of
                    monthly active users for his Twitter alternative has been
                    steadily climbing over the past couple of months to have now
                    reached 2.1 million — or, as remarked Rochko, "not far off

                    Before, Mastodon had been a much smaller network, with

                    The fate of Mastodon's growth seems often to be tied to
                    Twitter's moves — or rather, its missteps. After Twitter's
                    acquisition, for example, there was a bit of a Twitter
                    exodus as longtime users rebelled against the changes that
                    Musk soon enacted on their favorite microblogging site,

                    Heart failure is an umbrella term for when the heart is
                    unable to pump blood around the body properly. Current ways
                    of classifying heart failure do not accurately predict how
                    the disease is likely to progress.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Using several machine learning methods, they
                    identified five subtypes: early onset, late onset, atrial
                    fibrillation related (atrial fibrillation is a condition
                    causing an irregular heart rhythm), metabolic (linked to
                    obesity but with a low rate of cardiovascular disease), and
                    cardiometabolic (linked to obesity and cardiovascular
                    disease).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers found differences between the subtypes in
                    patients' risk of dying in the year after diagnosis. The
                    all-cause mortality risks at one year were: early onset
                    (20%), late onset (46%), atrial fibrillation related (61%),
                    metabolic (11%), and cardiometabolic (37%).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The next step is to see if this way of classifying
                    heart failure can make a practical difference to patients –
                    whether it improves predictions of risk and the quality of
                    information clinicians provide, and whether it changes
                    patients' treatment. We also need to know if it would be
                    cost effective. The app we have designed needs to be
                    evaluated in a clinical trial or further research, but could
                    help in routine care."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The subtypes were established on the basis of 87 (of a
                    possible 635) factors including age, symptoms, the presence
                    of other conditions, the medications the patient was taking,
                    and the results of tests (e.g., of blood pressure) and
                    assessments (e.g., of kidney function).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team also looked at genetic data from 9,573 individuals
                    with heart failure from the UK Biobank study. They found a
                    link between particular subtypes of heart failure and higher
                    polygenic risk scores (scores of overall risk due to genes
                    as a whole) for conditions such as hypertension and atrial
                    fibrillation.

                    the Kremlin has kept classified and hidden from public view,
                    and he joins a growing roster of former Russian cybercrime
                    fighters who are now serving hard time for farcical treason
                    convictions.

                  <p>
                    In 2003, Sachkov founded <strong>Group-IB</strong>, a
                    cybersecurity and digital forensics company that quickly
                    earned a reputation for exposing and disrupting large-scale
                    cybercrime operations, including quite a few that were based
                    in Russia and stealing from Russian companies and citizens.

                    In September 2021, the Kremlin issued treason charges
                    against Sachkov, although it has refused to disclose any
                    details about the allegations. Sachkov pleaded not guilty.
                    After a three-week "trial" that was closed to the public,
                    Sachkov was convicted of treason and

                Stanford University President, Dr. Marc Tessier-Lavigne, has
                <a href="https://archive.is/fZlYt"
                  >resigned after a university investigation</a
                >
                found that he had fostered an environment that led to "unusual
                frequency of manipulation of research data and/or substandard
                scientific practices" across labs at multiple institutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The review focused on five major papers for which he was listed
                as a principal author, finding evidence of manipulation of
                research data in four of them and a lack of scientific rigor in
                the fifth, a famous study that he said would "turn our current
                understanding of Alzheimer's on its head."
              </p>
              <p>
                The Stanford investigation did not find that Dr. Tessier-Lavigne
                personally altered data or pasted pieces of experimental images
                together. Instead, it found that he had presided over a lab
                culture that "tended to reward the 'winners' (that is, postdocs
                who could generate favorable results) and marginalize or
                diminish the 'losers' (that is, postdocs who were unable or
                struggled to generate such data)."
              </p>
              <p>
                A cynical Soylentil might see Dr. Tessier-Lavigne in much the
                same way as Al Capone who was only found guilty of tax evasion.
                Who benefited from falsification "across labs at multiple
                institutions"? It's well past time to put the scientists back in
                science and rethink the funding system that rewards the
                bullshitters.

                    Rapidus, a semiconductor consortium backed by the Japanese
                    government and industrial conglomerates, plans to start
                    high-volume production of chips on its 2nm fabrication
                    process in 2027. In a bid to ensure that all of its
                    production capacity is used, Rapidus wants to land orders
                    from at least one global company, essentially competing with

                    [...] In a bid to recoup production node R&amp;D costs and
                    fab costs, one needs to produce a boatload of chips on a
                    leading-edge node and Japanese companies may not generate
                    significant demand for such parts. Which is why Rapidus
                    needs to land orders from a multinational like

                    and Microsoft] corporations," said Atsuyoshi Koike, chief
                    executive of Rapidus, in an interview with <a

                    centers [and] right now, TSMC is the only company that can
                    make the semiconductors they envision. That is where Rapidus
                    will enter."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Interestingly, Rapidus is not looking forward serving
                    dozens of companies, but only intends to serve five to 10
                    clients.

                  <p>
                    [...] It remains to be seen whether 5 to 10 companies can
                    generate enough demand to recoup tens of billions of dollars
                    that Rapidus will need to invest to start 2nm production in
                    2027. Meanwhile, winning even five customers with
                    significant 2nm orders in 2027 will be quite difficult,
                    since the number of companies willing to invest in designs
                    to be made on a leading-edge node is fairly limited.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then again, from Japanese government point of view, Rapidus
                    is meant to rejuvenate the

                    — so even if the company's 2nm node does not turn out to be
                    a triumph, it will still pave the way for successors and
                    open new doors to local chip designers.

                    the same or lower than if the they were powered by a diesel
                    engine. The best size of battery is determined by whether
                    light loads are being transported, such as parcels or

                      NCommander responded "Ultimately, the proposal was sent to
                      matt_ and I, and discussed breaking up the shares. As I
                      discussed with you in DM, that ultimately didn't solve the
                      issue in regards to the general ownership problem, but I
                      was agreed to at least using it as a starting point point.
                      I did send it to matt, and got no response, which I did
                      tell you on Discord, there was no follow-up over it, and I
                      didn't talk with matt_ from [before] that discussion until
                      now... communication on the backend has ... well let's
                      just say its a known problem, and one that def. needs a
                      better solution."

                  Veyrdite asked, There are lots of opinions about which parts
                  of the org structure are problematic (and I suspect this will
                  get brought up in the meeting), so instead I am curious as to
                  which parts of the org structure work well? What should new
                  aspiring communities potentially copy?

                    <li>
                      NCommander responded in part, "Ultimately, while I was in
                      the role in project manager, I also held the role of
                      president. And I acted as executioner of the communities
                      wishes. There's *a lot of very long posts to that*.
                      However, after I stepped down in 2021 from that role,
                      there essentially became a large disconnect to this. The
                      problems had been building well before that, but the
                      wheels essentially fell off when the business/legal side
                      became detached from the operations/community side of
                      things."

                </li>
                <li>
                  Veyrdite asked, It sounds like having the org worked at first.
                  Would you suggest other (new) projects do an org the same way,
                  or something different?

                    <li>
                      NCommander answered in part, "For the new org? It needs to
                      be specifically defined who is responsible for who does
                      what. And there needs to be a clear way to change the
                      guard. No one should be stuck in a position they don't
                      want to be, and people need to be replaceable; any of us
                      can be hit by a car tomorrow."

                <li>
                  Veyrdite asked, I have heard "NDA" been mentioned. This seems
                  dissonant for a public site with volunteers. Can you explain
                  what is going on here?

                    <li>
                      Kolie answered, "I approached NC when the shutdown
                      happened. We were discussing the site, its data, etc. I
                      agreed to an NDA to not disclose anything. As an outsider
                      - I was given access to the internals of the data, pbc,
                      etc. The purpose of the NDA was to safeguard the PBC from
                      liability given access to someone outside of everything.
                      It was overly broad, generic NDA. It has since been
                      removed and is not in effect. It was from legal zoom -
                      it's purpose literally for liability and there was no
                      nefarious background being discussed behind it. Everything
                      discussed at that time has since become public."

                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Another question from Veyrdite, Are there any other NDAs
                  currently in force in this organisation?
                </li>
                <li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Kolie and NCommander both said that they knew of no other
                      NDAs.

                  For the final question of the Q&amp;A session, Deucalion
                  asked, What are the next steps? Proposed first step is to
                  contact the suggested committee members to see if a committee
                  can indeed be formed as suggested.

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The result of the question was discussion among the
                      potential governance committee members about forming the
                      committee.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p><b>The governance committee</b></p>
              <p>
                As of this writing, the governance committee consists of kolie,
                audioguy, mechanicjay, requerdanos, Deucalion, and Fnord666,
                with possible other new members added from among staff/editors
                within the next few days.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of the committee, kolie says "The committee is to self govern
                and determine its own fate. I want a call to those who haven't
                accepted yet to answer - and to those interested to come around.
                [For] the community to participate in #governance and to work
                with myself as the chair or committee members to include their
                input and set up whatever's coming next."
              </p>
              <p>
                The business of the governance committee will happen in the
                #governance channel on SoylentNews IRC and in their expected
                upcoming meta and/or journal posts.

                    For more than 25 years, a technology used for critical data
                    and voice radio communications around the world has been
                    shrouded in secrecy to prevent anyone from closely
                    scrutinizing its security properties for vulnerabilities.
                    But now it's finally getting a public airing thanks to a
                    small group of researchers in the Netherlands who got their
                    hands on its viscera and found serious flaws, including a
                    deliberate backdoor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The backdoor, known for years by vendors that sold the
                    technology but not necessarily by customers, exists in an
                    encryption algorithm baked into radios sold for commercial
                    use in critical infrastructure. It's used to transmit
                    encrypted data and commands in pipelines, railways, the
                    electric grid, mass transit, and freight trains. It would
                    allow someone to snoop on communications to learn how a
                    system works, then potentially send commands to the radios
                    that could trigger blackouts, halt gas pipeline flows, or
                    reroute trains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers found a second vulnerability in a different part
                    of the same radio technology that is used in more
                    specialized systems sold exclusively to police forces,
                    prison personnel, military, intelligence agencies, and
                    emergency services, such as the<a
                      href="https://www.government.nl/topics/counterterrorism-and-national-security/c2000-communication-system-for-emergency-services"

                      C2000 communication system</a
                    >
                    used by Dutch police, fire brigades, ambulance services, and
                    Ministry of Defense for mission-critical voice and data
                    communications. The flaw would let someone decrypt encrypted
                    voice and data communications and send fraudulent messages
                    to spread misinformation or redirect personnel and forces
                    during critical times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Three Dutch security analysts discovered the
                    vulnerabilities—five in total—in a European radio standard
                    called TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio), which is used in
                    radios made by Motorola, Damm, Hytera, and others. The
                    standard has been used in radios since the '90s, but the
                    flaws remained unknown because encryption algorithms used in
                    TETRA were kept secret until now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers say anyone using radio technologies
                    should check with their manufacturer to determine if their
                    devices are using TETRA and what fixes or mitigations are
                    available.

                    "Assigning role obligations to robots encourages teamwork,
                    which triggers an understanding that fulfilling those
                    obligations should be done harmoniously," explains Kim.
                    "Artificial intelligence (AI) imitates human intelligence,
                    so for robots to develop as rites bearers, they must be
                    powered by a type of AI that can imitate humans' capacity to
                    recognize and execute team activities—and a machine can
                    learn that ability in various ways."

                  <p>
                    Kim acknowledges that some will question why robots should
                    be treated respectfully in the first place. "To the extent
                    that we make robots in our image, if we don't treat them
                    well, as entities capable of participating in rites, we
                    degrade ourselves," he suggests.

                    The European Space Agency (ESA) has awarded a contract to a
                    US company to create a technology demonstrator for a
                    proposed aircraft monitoring system using low Earth orbit
                    satellites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <a href="https://spire.com/">Spire Global</a>, headquartered
                    in San Francisco, won the €16 million ($17.6 million)
                    agreement for the EURIALO project, which aims to prove that
                    a satellite-based system can monitor aircraft in flight for
                    air traffic management purposes, without relying on any
                    existing systems.

                    intends to demonstrate the viability of using satellites to
                    track aircraft by determining in real time the aircraft
                    position based on timing the arrival of radio signals
                    detected by multiple satellites, a technique known as
                    multilateration. The radio signals in this case will be
                    standard telecoms radio signals already routinely broadcast
                    by aircraft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Current monitoring systems largely rely on self-reported
                    positions of aircraft, which are typically obtained from
                    satellite navigation systems. The objective of EURIALO is to
                    provide a complementary tracking system that can feed
                    location data to existing air navigation service providers
                    for integration into their services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, this could help track planes in real time from
                    takeoff to landing anywhere in the world and could more
                    speedily locate aircraft in the event of an emergency. It
                    isn't clear whether such a system would have helped in the

                    was apparently switched off mid-flight, as was the Aircraft

                    Under the terms of the contract, Spire will develop a design
                    for an operational satellite constellation then deploy and
                    operate a demonstrator mission that proves the performance
                    of the service. It will head up a consortium of other
                    companies as part of the project, including European
                    Satellite Services Provider (ESSP), which was founded by
                    seven air navigation service providers and is based in

                    In November 2024, if all goes to plan, the Artemis II
                    mission will send a crew of four astronauts—three American
                    and one Canadian—around the moon on a 10-day mission in

                    Humans have not traveled to the moon since Apollo 17 in
                    1972. The goal, however, is "not just returning, but staying
                    and exploring," says Merancy. Artemis II "is really ensuring
                    that the vehicles are ready for longer-duration missions in
                    the future."

                    [...] But the goal "isn't just Mars," says Teasel
                    Muir-Harmony, a curator at the National Air and Space Museum
                    in Washington, DC. "It's learning how to live and work in
                    deep space and creating a sustained presence further than
                    Earth orbit."

                    International laws will need to be updated to cope with this
                    uptick in lunar activity. At the moment, such activities are
                    largely governed by the Outer Space Treaty, signed in 1967,
                    but many of its particulars are vague.

                    "We are getting into areas like private space platforms and
                    lunar mining facilities, for which there really is no clear
                    government precedent," says Scott Pace, a space policy
                    expert at George Washington University and former executive
                    secretary of the National Space Council in the US. "We have
                    to be responsible for activities in space."

                  <p>
                    [...] Lunar missions could come thick and fast while these
                    discussions take place, potentially moving us into a new
                    dawn of space travel. "With the International Space Station,
                    we learned how to live and work in low Earth orbit," says
                    Muir-Harmony. "Now there's this opportunity to learn how to
                    do that on another celestial body, and then travel to
                    Mars—and perhaps other locations."

                    Rumor mill: If you're considering buying an Intel CPU, it
                    might be a good idea to splash out sooner rather than later
                    as they could get a price hike. The claim comes from a new
                    report that states Team Blue is increasing the price of all
                    its Core lineup to help fund new fabs and restructure the
                    company.

                    According to the letter, all Core processors that are
                    currently on sale or in production will become more
                    expensive. That covers the Alder Lake (12xxx), Raptor Lake

                  <p>
                    According to the letter, the price increases are related to
                    current and future Intel factories that have to be
                    refinanced. It also states that the company is

                  <p>
                    [...] It was only in January when Intel implemented the last
                    CPU price hike, an estimated 10% rise on the Alder Lake
                    chips' MSRP. It seems quite soon for another rise, but it
                    sounds like Intel could use the money.
