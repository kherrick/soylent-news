                  <p>
                    In an era when anyone can create artificial intelligence
                    (AI) images, the ability to detect fake pictures,
                    particularly deepfakes of people, is becoming increasingly
                    important. Now, scientists say the eyes may be the key to
                    distinguishing deepfakes from real images.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    New research presented at the Royal Astronomical Society's
                    National Astronomy Meeting indicates that deepfakes can be
                    identified by analyzing the reflections in human eyes,
                    similar to how astronomers study pictures of galaxies. The
                    study, led by University of Hull MSc student Adejumoke
                    Owolabi, focuses on the consistency of light reflections in
                    each eyeball. Discrepancies in these reflections often
                    indicate a fake image.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The reflections in the eyeballs are consistent for the real
                    person, but incorrect (from a physics point of view) for the
                    fake person," said Kevin Pimbblet, professor of astrophysics
                    and director of the Centre of Excellence for Data Science,
                    Artificial Intelligence and Modelling at the University of
                    Hull.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers analyzed reflections of light on the eyeballs of
                    people in real and AI-generated images. They then employed
                    methods typically used in astronomy to quantify the
                    reflections and checked for consistency between left and
                    right eyeball reflections.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fake images often lack consistency in the reflections
                    between each eye, whereas real images generally show the
                    same reflections in both eyes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "To measure the shapes of galaxies, we analyze whether
                    they're centrally compact, whether they're symmetric, and
                    how smooth they are. We analyze the light distribution,"
                    said Pimbblet. "We detect the reflections in an automated
                    way and run their morphological features through the CAS
                    [concentration, asymmetry, smoothness] and Gini indices to
                    compare similarity between left and right eyeballs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The findings show that deepfakes have some differences
                    between the pair."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Gini coefficient is normally used to measure how the
                    light in an image of a galaxy is distributed among its
                    pixels. This measurement is made by ordering the pixels that
                    make up the image of a galaxy in ascending order by flux and
                    then comparing the result to what would be expected from a
                    perfectly even flux distribution. A Gini value of 0 is a
                    galaxy in which the light is evenly distributed across all
                    of the image's pixels, while a Gini value of 1 is a galaxy
                    with all light concentrated in a single pixel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team also tested CAS parameters, a tool originally
                    developed by astronomers to measure the light distribution
                    of galaxies to determine their morphology, but found it was
                    not a successful predictor of fake eyes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's important to note that this is not a silver bullet for
                    detecting fake images," Pimbblet added. "There are false
                    positives and false negatives; it's not going to get
                    everything. But this method provides us with a basis, a plan
                    of attack, in the arms race to detect deepfakes."

                    When giant solar storms hit Earth, they trigger beautiful
                    auroral displays high in Earth's atmosphere. There's a dark
                    side to this solar activity, though. The "space weather" it
                    sets off also threatens our technology. The potential for
                    damage is why we need highly accurate predictions of just
                    when these storms will impact our planet's magnetosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To figure that out, scientists in England went to the
                    source: specific places on the sun where these storms erupt.
                    Those outbursts are called coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
                    They're huge explosions of magnetically charged particles
                    and gases from the sun. They travel through space and hit
                    whatever is in their way, including planets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When that cloud of charged particles hits our magnetic
                    field, it sets off a chain reaction of events. Of course, it
                    creates beautiful auroral displays—northern and southern
                    lights that dance in the skies. But, they also slam into and
                    can damage orbiting satellites, including all our
                    telecommunications and navigation systems for planes, boats,
                    and trains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The team found a very strong relationship between the
                    critical height of the CME as it gets started and its true
                    speed as it moves out. "This insight allows us to predict
                    the CME's speed and, consequently, its arrival time on
                    Earth, even before the CME has fully erupted," Ghandhi said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Knowing the actual speed of the CME to a higher degree of
                    accuracy will let solar physicists predict when it will hit
                    Earth. That, in turn, will allow satellite operators, grid
                    owners, space agencies, and others to prepare for the action
                    and protect their assets.

                Scientist suggest building a biorepository on the moon, like a
                extra terrestrial Svalbard Global Seed Vault. If/when earth
                collapses how are the survivors going to make it to the moon to
                kickstart things? Or are we expecting benevolent xenomorphs to
                bring us back to life?

                    Researchers propose a lunar biorepository to protect Earth's
                    endangered species by utilizing the Moon's cold temperatures
                    for long-term storage of biological samples. This initiative
                    seeks to overcome Earth's natural and political risks by
                    fostering global collaboration and developing new
                    technologies for space transport and sample preservation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Faced with the threat of extinction for numerous species, an
                    international team of researchers has suggested a
                    groundbreaking solution to safeguard the planet's
                    biodiversity: a lunar biorepository. As outlined in a recent
                    article in the journal <em>BioScience</em>, this plan
                    involves establishing a passive, enduring storage facility
                    on the moon for cryopreserved samples of Earth's most
                    endangered animal species.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Led by Dr. Mary Hagedorn of the Smithsonian's National Zoo
                    and Conservation Biology Institute, the team envisions
                    taking advantage of the Moon's naturally cold temperatures,
                    particularly in permanently shadowed regions near the poles,
                    where temperatures remain consistently below –196 degrees
                    Celsius. Such conditions are ideal for long-term storage of
                    biological samples without the need for human intervention
                    or power supplies, two factors that could threaten the
                    resilience of Earth-based repositories. Other key advantages
                    of a lunar facility include protection from Earth-based
                    natural disasters, climate change, and geopolitical
                    conflicts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An initial focus in the development of a lunar biorepository
                    would be on cryopreserving animal skin samples with
                    fibroblast cells. The author team has already begun
                    developing protocols using the Starry Goby (<em
                      >Asterropteryx semipunctata</em
                    >) as an exemplar species, with other species to follow. The
                    authors also plan to "leverage the continental-scale
                    sampling that is currently underway at the U S National
                    Science Foundation's National 190 Ecological Observatory
                    Network (NEON)" as a source for future fibroblast cell
                    development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Challenges to be addressed include developing robust
                    packaging for space transport, mitigating radiation effects,
                    and establishing the complex international governance
                    frameworks for the repository. The authors call for broad
                    collaboration among nations, agencies, and international
                    stakeholders to realize this decades-long program. The next
                    steps include expanding partnerships, particularly with
                    space research agencies, and conducting further testing on
                    Earth and aboard the International Space Station.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite the challenges to be overcome, the authors highlight
                    that the need for action is acute: "Because of myriad
                    anthropogenic drivers, a high proportion of species and
                    ecosystems face destabilization and extinction threats that
                    are accelerating faster than our ability to save these
                    species in their natural environment."

                    optical communications, which use infrared light signals
                    instead of the more conventional radio waves to transmit
                    data. As part of these efforts, it recently conducted a
                    series of flight tests that involved installing a laser
                    terminal on the belly of a Pilatus PC-12 aircraft. This
                    single-engine plane then proceeded to beam 4K video while
                    soaring over Lake Erie to a ground station in Cleveland,
                    Ohio.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    From there, the video signal went on an epic journey,
                    passing through NASA's White Sands facility in New Mexico
                    before being fired off into space 22,000 miles away using
                    infrared lasers towards an experimental satellite called the
                    Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD). The LCRD
                    then relayed the data to a special terminal aboard the ISS
                    called ILLUMA-T, which beamed it back to Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite this incredibly long distance, NASA says the laser
                    link achieved transmission rates of over 900 Mbps. To put
                    that into perspective, the average household internet in the
                    US churns out 245 Mbps as of June 2024.

                    For many years, insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor
                    spraying have been crucial and highly effective methods for
                    controlling mosquitoes that spread malaria, a serious global
                    health threat. These strategies have also, incidentally,
                    helped to reduce populations of other unwanted household
                    pests such as bed bugs, cockroaches, and flies.
                  </p>

                    >
                    study reviewing the academic literature on indoor pest
                    control shows that as the household insects developed
                    resistance to the insecticides targeting mosquitoes, the
                    return of these bed bugs, cockroaches and flies into homes
                    has led to community distrust and often abandonment of these
                    treatments – and to rising rates of malaria.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In short, the bed nets and insecticide treatments that were
                    so effective in preventing mosquito bites – and therefore
                    malaria – are increasingly viewed as the causes of household
                    pest resurgence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “These insecticide-treated bed nets were not intended to
                    kill household pests like bed bugs, but they were really
                    good at it,” said Chris Hayes, an NC State Ph.D. student and
                    co-corresponding author of a paper describing the work.
                    “It’s what people really liked, but the insecticides are not
                    working as effectively on household pests anymore.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Non-target effects are usually harmful, but in this case
                    they were beneficial,” said Coby Schal, Blanton J. Whitmire
                    Distinguished Professor of Entomology at NC State and
                    co-corresponding author of the paper.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The value to people wasn’t necessarily in reducing malaria,
                    but was in killing other pests,” Hayes added. “There’s
                    probably a link between the use of these nets and widespread
                    insecticide resistance in these house pests, at least in
                    Africa.”

                    “There are, ideally, two routes,” Schal said. “One would be
                    a two-pronged approach with both mosquito treatment and a
                    separate urban pest management treatment that targets pests.
                    The other would be the discovery of new malaria-control
                    tools that also target these household pests at the same
                    time. For example, the bottom portion of a bed net could be
                    a different chemistry that targets cockroaches and bed bugs.

                    China controls approximately 75% of global lithium-ion

                    [...] While the absence of the high-tech industrial capacity
                    needed for economic security is easy to label, it is not
                    simple to address. Doing so requires several interrelated
                    elements, among them designing and incentivizing appropriate
                    capital investments, creating and matching demand for a
                    talented technology workforce, building robust industrial
                    infrastructure, ensuring visibility into supply chains, and
                    providing favorable financial and regulatory environments
                    for on- and friend-shoring of production. This is a project
                    that cannot be done by the public or the private sector
                    alone. Nor is the US likely to accomplish it absent
                    carefully crafted shared partnerships with allies and
                    partners across both the Atlantic and the Pacific.

                    The opportunity to support today’s drones may have passed,
                    but we do have the chance to build a strong industrial base
                    to support tomorrow’s most critical technologies—not simply
                    the eye-catching finished assemblies of autonomous vehicles,
                    satellites, or robots but also their essential components.
                    This will require attention to our manufacturing
                    capabilities, our supply chains, and the materials that are
                    the essential inputs. Alongside a shift in emphasis to our
                    own domestic industrial base must come a willingness to plan
                    and partner more effectively with allies and partners.

                  <p>
                    If we do so, we will transform decades of US and allied
                    support for foundational science and technology into
                    tomorrow’s industrial base vital for economic prosperity and
                    national security. But to truly take advantage of this
                    opportunity, we need to value and support our shared,
                    long-term economic security. And this means rewarding
                    patient investment in projects that take a decade or more,
                    incentivizing high-capital industrial activity, and
                    maintaining a determined focus on education and workforce
                    development—all within a flexible regulatory framework.

                Several decades ago, a torn UCL was generally a career ending
                injury. In 1974, Dodgers' pitcher
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_John"
                  >Tommy John</a
                >
                was the first baseball player to undergo a

                  >UCL reconstruction</a
                >, which involves grafting a tendon in place of the UCL, taking
                the tendon from elsewhere in the body or a donor. The procedure
                has become known as "Tommy John surgery" and has a high success
                rate, though with a long recovery time. However, continuing to
                pitch with high velocity and spin rates has led to the injury
                recurring a few years later and requiring a second surgery.
                There is also evidence that

                pitcher can rest between pitches. Although the pitch clock
                improves the pace of games, it has

              <p>
                The obvious question is why pitchers would be willing to throw
                pitches at high velocities and spin rates knowing that the
                result is likely Tommy John surgery. The answer is that there
                are only so many spots on a major league roster available, and
                if one pitcher isn't willing to assume that risk, someone else
                will. The best starting pitchers get massive contracts that pay
                tens of millions of dollars per year, so there's a lot of money
                potentially available for those willing to accept the high risk
                of injuries. Even at lower levels, pitchers know that if they
                want to be successful, they need to be able to throw the ball
                hard. There has even been

                Fortunately, the same data that allows us to link pitch velocity
                and spin rate with effectiveness may also offer a solution to
                reduce injuries. Tracking pitch velocity and spin rate can allow
                us to determine how frequently pitchers are throwing pitches
                that contribute most to UCL injuries. One proposal is to
                <a
                  href="https://blogs.fangraphs.com/a-high-velocity-usage-tax-a-proposal-to-protect-pitchers/"
                  >track the number of high risk pitches thrown by each pitcher
                  and imposing a cap on a pitcher's innings in a season</a
                >, progressively lowering that cap for pitchers who throw more
                high risk pitches. Part of a pitcher's value to a team is their
                availability. If a pitcher is unavailable because they've
                reached their innings cap, they're less valuable to a team,
                providing an incentive to reduce the number of pitches thrown at
                high velocity and perhaps high spin rates. The proposed rule in
                the linked article focuses on fastballs, but a similar strategy
                could be applied to other high risk pitches.

                    to servers using a centralized platform in large
                    corporations," Dr Martin J Kraemer, security awareness

                    ESX without AD while AD runs on ESX? Admins must think about

                    Microsoft also said that ESXi hypervisors often fly further
                    under the radar in security operations centers (SOCs)
                    because security solutions often don't have the necessary
                    visibility into ESXi, potentially allowing attackers to go
                    undetected for longer periods of time.

                From ScienceBlog: A comprehensive analysis of 24
                state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) has uncovered a
                significant left-of-center bias in their responses to
                politically charged questions. The study, published in PLOS ONE,
                sheds light on the potential political leanings embedded within
                AI systems that are increasingly shaping our digital landscape.
              </p>
              <p>
                The underlying paper at PLOS One:
                <a
                  href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0306621"

                >
              </p>
              <p>
                The researcher used a variety of tests of political alignment to
                assess the bias of some Large Language Models (LLMs) and found
                that they exhibited a left-of-center bias. To discover whether
                that bias can be affected by changing the training data,
                versions of LLMs were trained on selected sources, producing
                biases to order.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's a question for the community: Is the 'centerpoint' of
                political bias, as judged by these tests, arbitrary and
                reflective of the gamut of bias that is accepted as normal at
                this time? Is that centerpoint an absolute that can be used as a
                reference, or is it simply an artifact of how the political
                universe is currently understood? It seems to me that the phase
                space it exists in is limited by the kinds of political
                organizations which are preset in the world today, and that
                there might be valid solutions which have not yet been explored.

                    The IBM report suggests that severe staffing shortages are
                    linked to higher data breach costs – more than half of the
                    604 organisations studied had severe or high-level staffing
                    shortages last year.

                  <p>
                    Businesses with high levels of staffing issues had an
                    average data breach cost of €5.28m, compared to €3.66m for
                    businesses with lower levels. This trend may be reduced in
                    the near future, as more organisations said they are
                    planning to increase security budgets compared to last year.

                    An international team of scientists, including two
                    researchers who now work in the Center for Advanced Sensor
                    Technology (CAST) at UMBC, has shown that twisted carbon
                    nanotubes can store three times more energy per unit mass
                    than advanced lithium-ion batteries. The finding may advance

                    [...] The researchers studied single-walled carbon
                    nanotubes, which are like straws made from pure carbon
                    sheets only 1-atom thick. Carbon nanotubes are lightweight,
                    relatively easy to manufacture, and about 100 times stronger
                    than steel. Their amazing properties have led scientists to

                  <p>
                    To investigate carbon nanotubes' potential for storing
                    energy, the UMBC researchers and their colleagues
                    manufactured carbon nanotube "ropes" from bundles of
                    commercially available nanotubes. After pulling and twisting
                    the tubes into a single thread, the researchers then coated
                    them with different substances intended to increase the
                    ropes' strength and flexibility.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team tested how much energy the ropes could store by
                    twisting them up and measuring the energy that was released
                    as the ropes unwound. They found that the best-performing
                    ropes could store 15,000 times more energy per unit mass
                    than steel springs, and about three times more energy than
                    lithium-ion batteries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The stored energy remains consistent and accessible at
                    temperatures ranging from -76 to +212 °F (-60 to +100 °C).
                    The materials in the carbon nanotube ropes are also safer
                    for the human body than those used in batteries.
                  </p>

                    "Humans have long stored energy in mechanical coil springs
                    to power devices such as watches and toys," Kumar Ujjain
                    says. "This research shows twisted carbon nanotubes have
                    great potential for mechanical energy storage, and we are
                    excited to share the news with the world."

                    Reddit CEO Steve Huffman is standing by Reddit's decision to
                    block companies from scraping the site without an AI
                    agreement.

                    today, Huffman stood by the changes that led to Google
                    temporarily being the only search engine able to show recent
                    discussions from Reddit. Reddit and Google signed an

                    "[It's been] a real pain in the ass to block these
                    companies," Huffman told The Verge.<br />[...]<br />A
                    Microsoft spokesperson told me last week that "Microsoft
                    respects the robots.txt standard and we honor the directions
                    provided by websites that do not want content on their pages
                    to be used with our generative AI models."<br />[...]<br />Huffman
                    also reportedly made reference to a June

                    where Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, said: "I think
                    that with respect to content that is already on the open
                    web, the social contract of that content since the '90s has
                    been that it is fair use. Anyone can copy it, re-create with
                    it, reproduce with it. That has been freeware, if you like.
                    That's been the understanding." Suleyman added that his
                    comment didn't refer to certain types of web content, like
                    news organizations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We've had Microsoft, Anthropic, and Perplexity act as
                    though all of the content on the internet is free for them
                    to use. That's their real position," Huffman said.

                undoubtably covered by fair use in United States copyright law.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    It is unfortunately well known that the DMCA is used by
                    corporate cyberbullies to take down content that they
                    disagree with; but, is otherwise legal. The Counternotice
                    system is also hillariously ineffective. The DMCA requires
                    service providers to "act expeditiously to remove or disable
                    access to the infringing material;" yet, it gives those same
                    "service providers" 14 days to restore access in the event
                    of a counternotice! The DMCA, like much American
                    legislation, is heavily biased towards corporations, instead
                    of the actual, living, breathing, citizens of the country.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's absolutely asinine and I would love absolutely nothing
                    more than to have a lawsuit "win" against CrowdStrike. That
                    would be absolutely amazing for marketing! Especially given
                    the timing of such events...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, using the Digital Millenium Copyright Act to
                    attempt to takedown a parody site for Trademark Infringement
                    is absolutely hillarious.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are several ways that anyone is allowed to use a
                    trademark belonging to "others." This is considered "Fair
                    Use." Fair Use is an important aspect of trademark and
                    copyright law. It is a right to use trademarks and
                    copyrighted works for parody, criticism, transformative
                    works, news reporting / journalism, education, etc.
                    Corporate cyberbullies don't like that anyone else has
                    rights. Again, I don't care, because the only thing that
                    matters is the law, and what a court thinks about it.

                    The authors also predict that the expansion of the boundary
                    conditions has its consequences: a new kind of quantum
                    entanglement appears in the theory, mixing past and future,
                    which is not present in conventional particle theory. The
                    paper also raises the question of whether tachyons described
                    in this way are purely a ‘mathematical possibility’ or
                    whether such particles are likely to be observed one day.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the authors, tachyons are not only a
                    possibility but are, in fact, an indispensable component of
                    the spontaneous breaking process responsible for the
                    formation of matter. This hypothesis would mean that Higgs
                    field excitations, before the symmetry was spontaneously

                    The AI Act won’t be felt until six months, when prohibitions
                    will apply against unacceptable-risk AI applications. The
                    rules for general-purpose AI models will apply one year from
                    now, while the majority of rules of the AI Act will start
                    applying on 2 August 2026.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, EU member states have until 2 August 2025 to
                    designate “national competent authorities”, which will
                    oversee the application of the AI Act and carry out market
                    surveillance activities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With AI making its way into so many use cases, it will be
                    important for businesses of all sizes to consider the type
                    of AI systems they are using and where they fall into the AI
                    Act’s risk tiers. Phil Burr, head of product at Lumai, said
                    the biggest risk businesses face is ignoring the Act.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The good news is that the Act takes a risk-based approach
                    and, given that the vast majority of AI will be minimal or
                    low-risk, the requirements on businesses using AI will be
                    relatively small,” Burr said. “It’s likely to be far less
                    than the effort required to implement the GDPR regulations,
                    for example.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The biggest problem for compliance is the need to document
                    and then perform regular assessments to ensure that the AI
                    risks – and therefore requirements – haven’t changed. For
                    the majority of businesses there won’t be a change in risk,
                    but business at least need to remember to perform these.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While businesses have plenty of time to prepare, the road
                    ahead is not clear for them. Forrester principal analyst
                    Enza Iannopollo noted that firms don’t have any pre-existing
                    experience of complying with these type of rules, which adds
                    “complexity to the challenge”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Right now, it’s crucial that organisations ensure they
                    understand what theirs and their providers’ obligations are
                    in order to be compliant on time,” Iannopollo said. “This is
                    the time for organisations to map their AI projects,
                    classify their AI systems and risk assess their use-cases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “They also need to execute a compliance roadmap that is
                    specific to the amount and combination of use-cases they
                    have. Once this work is done, every company will have a
                    compliance roadmap that is unique to them.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To bridge the period between now and the full implementation
                    of the Act, the European Commission has launched the ‘AI
                    Pact’, which is initiative for AI developers to voluntarily
                    adopt key obligations of the Act ahead of its legal
                    deadlines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The EU has been introducing stronger penalties for breaches
                    in its more recent legislation, with the Digital Markets Act
                    and Digital Services Act carrying heavy fines for
                    non-compliance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The AI Act is no exception to this approach, as companies
                    that breach the Act could face fines of up to 7pc of their
                    global annual turnover for violations of banned AI
                    applications. They will also face fines of up to 3pc for
                    violations of other obligations and up to 1.5pc for
                    supplying incorrect information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “For reference, GDPR caps maximum fines to 4pc of
                    annual turnover, whereas EU competition law caps this at
                    10pc,” Koskinen said. “This comparison shows a clear
                    movement in regulatory enforcement for the AI Act, as the
                    maximum fines inch closer to those imposed on
                    anticompetitive behaviour.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “As businesses around the world look to Europe, the AI Act’s
                    requirements will lead the way in responsible AI innovation
                    and governance, while ensuring organisations are prepared
                    for its rapidly approaching enforcement.”

                Just to give you advance notice that the continual problem with
                the renewal of SSL certificates is due to occur on Monday 5 Aug.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nobody in the new team has the necessary access nor knowledge of
                the current hardware configuration, and control remains with
                NCommander. The transfer of assets has been initiated but as one
                of the two members of the current Board is out of the country
                everything has temporarily ground to a halt. We cannot
                reconfigure the existing structure as legally we do not yet
                'own' the database or existing hardware assets.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have requested that NCommander assist by renewing the
                certificates but that depends upon his availability. He has been
                kind enough to help in the past. There is nothing more I can do
                at the moment.
              </p>
              <p>
                I know that this is easily fixed - but until the formal exchange
                of the assets takes place we are on very shaky ground with
                regards to liabilities and responsibilities.

                    The Cheshire ATT facility is an underground complex
                    originally built in 1966. It was an underground terminal and
                    repeater station for the hardened analog L4 carrier cable
                    (coax) that went from Miami to New England carrying general
                    toll circuits and critical military communication circuits.
                    It reportedly housed an AUTOVON 4-wire switch as part of the
                    switching fabric of that critical global military
                    communications network. Cheshire also connected via
                    terrestrial microwave to the major, semi-hardened AT&amp;T
                    Durham station which linked to many other sites including
                    paths to New London (Navy Sub base) and to Green Hill, RI to
                    meet a transatlantic cable to Europe.

                    Amazon failed to adequately alert more than 300,000
                    customers to serious risks—including death and
                    electrocution—that US Consumer Product Safety Commission
                    (CPSC) testing found with more than 400,000 products that
                    third parties sold on its platform.<br />[...]<br />Instead
                    of recalling the products, which were sold between 2018 and
                    2021, Amazon sent messages to customers that the CPSC said
                    "downplayed the severity" of hazards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In these messages—"despite conclusive testing that the
                    products were hazardous" by the CPSC—Amazon only warned
                    customers that the products "may fail" to meet federal
                    safety standards and only "potentially" posed risks of "burn
                    injuries to children," "electric shock," or "exposure to
                    potentially dangerous levels of carbon monoxide."

                    Typically, a distributor would be required to specifically
                    use the word "recall" in the subject line of these kinds of
                    messages, but Amazon dodged using that language entirely.<br />[...]<br />The
                    CPSC has additional concerns about Amazon's "insufficient"
                    remedies. It is particularly concerned that anyone who
                    received the products as a gift or bought them on the
                    secondary market likely was not informed of serious known
                    hazards. The CPSC found that Amazon resold faulty hair
                    dryers and carbon monoxide detectors, proving that secondary
                    markets for these products exist.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Amazon has made no direct attempt to reach consumers who
                    obtained the hazardous products as gifts, hand-me-downs,
                    donations, or on the secondary market," the CPSC said.<br />[...]<br />After
                    the CPSC's testing, Amazon stopped allowing these products
                    to be listed on its platform, but that and other remedies
                    were deemed insufficient. So, over the next two months, to
                    protect the public, Amazon must now make a plan to "provide
                    notice of the product hazards to purchasers and the public"
                    and "incentivize the removal of these hazardous products
                    from consumers' homes," the CPSC ordered.<br />[...]<br />To
                    make up for "significant deficiencies" in Amazon's initial
                    messaging, mandatory recall notices will likely include "a
                    description of the product (including a photograph), hazard,
                    injuries, deaths, action being taken, and remedy," provide
                    "relevant dates and number of units" sold, and specifically
                    use "the word 'recall' in the heading and text," the CPSC
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Amazon's spokesperson told Ars that "in the event of a
                    product recall in our store, we remove impacted products
                    promptly after receiving actionable information from
                    recalling agencies, and we continue to seek ways to innovate
                    on behalf of our customers."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our recalls alerts service also ensures our customers are
                    notified of important product safety information fast, and
                    the recalls process is effective and efficient," Amazon's
                    spokesperson said.
                  </p>
                  <p>

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    In recent weeks, two refreshed car models have been
                    launched: Hyundai's Ioniq 5 and BYD's SEAL. Both models,
                    introduced in 2021 and 2022 respectively, are receiving
                    significant updates ahead of the typical five-year facelift
                    cycle. This global automotive industry standard generally
                    involves cosmetic upgrades to keep cars relevant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, these updates are more than just aesthetic. The
                    Hyundai Ioniq 5 now features a substantial battery upgrade,
                    increasing from 72.6 kWh to 84 kWh. This enhancement boosts
                    the top model's range from 480 km to over 550 km. Other
                    upgrades include new wheel designs and interior materials,
                    but the major improvements lie beneath the surface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] These updates reflect a broader trend among electric
                    vehicle (EV) manufacturers, who have announced major
                    enhancements to existing models. Unlike mid-life upgrades in
                    gasoline cars, which often focus on superficial enhancements
                    like sound systems and wheel designs, EV upgrades are core
                    technological improvements. This trend is driven by several
                    factors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Recent trends in the used EV market show that the
                    introduction of significantly upgraded models or superior
                    competing models can deter buyers unless substantial
                    discounts are offered. The new Ioniq 5's increased range and
                    the SEAL's faster charging capabilities could negatively
                    affect the resale value of older models.

                    involving ICTs is conceptually and practically harmful.
                    Recent efforts at the domestic level to broaden its
                    definition have led to the criminalization of legitimate
                    activities, such as online criticism, religious expression,
                    or LGBTQ support. In the proposed treaty, it encourages
                    expansive interpretations that could lead to human rights
                    abuses and transnational repression.
                    <b>Recommendation:</b> Restrict the definition to "core
                    cybercrimes" like technical attacks on computers, devices,
                    data, and communications systems. Exclude human
                    rights-protected activities from the scope of the treaty to
                    prevent misuse and ensure these rights are not unjustly
                    targeted due to equating cybercrime with any crime using
                    ICT.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Expansive Scope and Over-Criminalization Risks: </b> The
                    draft Convention's criminalization chapter dangerously
                    broadens its scope by including crimes like "grooming" and
                    CSAM, not just cybercrimes. Its CSAM definition risks
                    criminalizing consensual conduct between minors. Even worse,
                    a proposed Protocol could add two more Ad Hoc sessions to
                    discuss even more crimes, further expanding its broad scope.
                    <b> Recommendation</b> : Criminalization must be limited to
                    Articles 7 to 11. Narrow the scope of the CSAM article to
                    target only intentional, malicious actions, exclude from
                    criminalization consensual activity between minors, make
                    exemptions for self-generated content by minors mandatory,
                    ensure financing provisions target only those knowingly
                    involved in illegal activities, and exclude the public
                    interest use of such materials, such as evidence in crime
                    investigations, and scientific or artistic materials.

                    The Knight Institute, alongside the Reporters Committee for
                    Freedom of the Press (RCFP), filed an amicus brief in
                    support of Sultanov's objection to the initial warrantless
                    search of his device. They argued that, specifics of the
                    case aside, allowing warrantless searches of cellphones at
                    the border - which the Department of Justice has long held
                    extends 100 miles from the actual physical edge of the US -
                    were likely to not only infringe upon fundamental rights
                    guaranteed by the constitution, but would have a chilling
                    effect on the ability of journalists to protect their
                    sources.

                    "Letting border agents freely rifle through journalists'
                    work product and communications whenever they cross the
                    border would pose an intolerable risk to press freedom,"
                    RCFP lawyer Grayson Clary said in a statement. "This
                    thorough opinion provides powerful guidance for other courts
                    grappling with this issue, and makes clear that the
                    Constitution would require a warrant before searching a
                    reporter's electronic devices."

                    This is not the first case to challenge CBP's sweeping
                    authority to seize and search devices at or near the US
                    border, and it probably won't be the last one either.

                    [...] Wilkens told us Morrison's decision was "thorough and
                    very well reasoned," and that he's confident it will hold up
                    to scrutiny if the government appeals that one, too.
                    Regardless, he believes the matter is ripe for a national
                    decision before the US Supreme Court, aka SCOTUS.

                    circuit courts are reaching conflicting results," Wilkins

                    Funding for free and open source software (FOSS) initiatives
                    under the EU's Horizon program has mostly vanished from next
                    year's proposal, claim advocates who are worried for the

                    Pierre-Yves Gibello, CEO of open-source consortium OW2,
                    urged EU officials to re-evaluate the elimination of funding
                    for the Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative from its
                    draft of 2025 Horizon funding programs in a recently

                    essential as the US, China and Russia mobilize "huge public
                    and private resources" toward capturing the personal data of
                    consumers, which the EU's regulatory regime has decided
                    isn't going to fly in its territory.

                    FOSS software, Gibello argued, is key to protecting European
                    interests from the data-guzzling economy that's grown up
                    elsewhere, which is why he's perplexed at the decision not
                    to fund NGI.

                    "We find this transformation incomprehensible, moreover when
                    NGI has proven efficient and economical to support free
                    software as a whole, from the smallest to the most
                    established initiative," Gibello said.

                    "Contrary to common perception, technical innovations often
                    originate from European rather than North American
                    programming communities, and are mostly initiated by
                    small-scaled organizations," he added.

                    Horizon funding has been doled out multiple times since the
                    program began. NGI has received tens of millions of euros
                    over the past few years under Cluster 4 of the program,
                    which doles out cash for digital, industry and space

                    Logitech CEO Hanneke Faber recently discussed the
                    possibility of one day selling a mouse that customers can
                    use "forever." The executive said such a mouse isn't
                    "necessarily super far away" and will rely on software
                    updates, likely delivered through a subscription model.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Speaking on a July 29 episode of The Verge's
                    <a

                    podcast, Faber, who Logitech appointed as CEO in October,
                    said that members of a "Logitech innovation center" showed
                    her "a forever mouse" and compared it to a nice but not
                    "super expensive" watch.<br />[...]<br />Speaking with
                    Faber, Decoder host and Verge Editor-in-Chief Nilay Patel
                    suggested that a "forever mouse" could cost $200. While that
                    would be expensive compared to the typical mouse, such a
                    product wouldn't be the first software-heavy,
                    three-figure-price computer mouse. Still, a price tag of
                    around $200 would limit the audience to professionals or
                    enthusiasts.<br />[...]<br />Alternatively, the price of the
                    mouse's hardware could be subsidized by subscription
                    payments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In any case, pushing out software updates would require
                    Logitech to convince its customers to use an app to control
                    their mouse. Such software can offer a lot of
                    programmability and macro support, but the need to
                    constantly run peripheral software could be a nuisance that
                    eats up computer resources. Earlier this year, users
                    complained when Logitech

                    >
                    to its peripherals.<br />[...]<br />Faber said subscription
                    software updates would mean that people wouldn't need to
                    worry about their mouse.<br />[...]<br />Having to pay a
                    regular fee for full use of a peripheral could deter

                    Two U.S. senators are calling on the Federal Trade
                    Commission to investigate automakers selling customers'
                    driving data to brokers who package it and then sell it to

                    and perhaps others are sharing drivers' data, such as sudden
                    braking and acceleration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The automakers, the senators said in a statement Friday,
                    used deceptive tactics to manipulate customers into signing
                    up for disclosure of the data to brokers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After reading a report in The New York Times, Wyden's office
                    looked into the three automakers and found that they shared
                    data with broker
                    <a href="https://fortune.com/company/verisk-analytics/"
                      >Verisk Analytics</a
                    >. In the letter to Khan, the senators wrote that all three
                    automakers confirmed disclosure of the data. GM also
                    confirmed that it disclosed customer location data to two
                    other companies that the automaker would not name, the
                    letter said.<br />[...]<br />"If the FTC determines that
                    these companies violated the law, we urge you to hold the
                    companies and their senior executives accountable," the
                    senators wrote to Khan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    GM wouldn't say how many cars' data was sent to brokers or
                    what it was paid, according to the letter. Wyden's office
                    found that Hyundai shared data from 1.7 million vehicles and
                    was paid just over $1 million, while Honda got just under
                    $26,000 for data from 97,000 vehicles, the senators said.

                sales? Will this (perhaps depending on the outcome of an FTC

                    [...] This was a bug in their crawler that was causing it to

                    bandwidth limiting in place, or support for Etags and
                    Last-Modified headers which would have allowed the crawler

                    this issue to them, and hopefully the issue will be fixed.

                    For the last 10 months, NASA's curiosity has been
                    investigating a region of Mount Sharp that is of high
                    interest. It has signs of a violent watery past and the
                    chemical analysis has revealed the presence of many minerals
                    including sulfates. And as the rover moved about it
                    accidentally cracked open a rock. And inside it saw pure
                    sulfur crystals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pure sulfur had never been seen before on Mars. And while
                    sulfates have sulfur, there is not a clear relationship
                    between the formation of those molecules and the pure
                    crystals. Elemental sulfur crystals form only in a narrow
                    range of conditions. And none of those have been expected
                    for this region.

                    "Finding a field of stones made of pure sulfur is like
                    finding an oasis in the desert," Curiosity's project

                    The region Curiosity is exploring is known as the Gediz
                    Vallis channel. It is a groove across Mount Sharp that has
                    been an area of interest since long before the rover began
                    climbing the relief in 2014. From orbit, scientists could
                    see the presence of large mounds of debris. But the cause of
                    them was not apparent. Was it landslides or ancient
                    floodwaters that shifted the material along the channel?

                    Curiosity has been able to provide an answer. A bit of
                    column A and a bit of column B. Rocks shifted by water are
                    smoother and rounded. Those shifted by dry avalanches are
                    angular and sharp. Both types of rocks are found among the
                    mounds.

                    [...] There is often a group of protesters outside the
                    offices of OpenAI in San Francisco, holding "Pause AI"
                    banners. This sentiment will only grow if AI is left
                    unregulated. It may be tempting for countries to treat AI
                    development as an arms race, to rush ahead irrespective of

                    With a unanimous 5-0 vote, the FCC says it is moving forward
                    with plans that should make unlocking your mobile phone
                    easier than ever. According to
                    <a
                      href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-404092A1.pdf"

                    >, the agency say it will begin crafting new rules that will
                    require that wireless carriers unlock customers’ mobile
                    phones within 60<br />days of activation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At various times unlocking your phone was deemed downright
                    illegal under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
                    Things have eased some over the years; very often it’s now
                    possible to unlock your device and change carriers if your
                    phone is paid off and you’re no longer under contract.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the FCC noted that the current guidelines surrounding
                    unlocking are a mish mash of voluntary industry standards
                    and more stringent unlocking requirements usually affixed to
                    either merger conditions or the use of certain spectrum. The
                    new rules should create some uniformity, and the FCC is
                    contemplating whether they should even apply to users still
                    under contract with their wireless carrier.
                  </p>

                    >, suggesting it won’t be that dramatic of a shift for the
                    industry. The industry already had to be dragged kicking and
                    screaming out of an era where it not only tried to lock down
                    devices, but tried to block consumer choice as it pertains
                    to apps, software and services (remember when Verizon

                    Chiseling away at the draconian DMCA as well as merger and
                    spectrum purchase conditions already did most of the heavy
                    lifting, and if the FCC’s rules are well crafted, they
                    should help finish the job.

                    Researchers have transformed guide RNAs, which direct
                    enzymes, into a smart RNA capable of controlling networks in
                    response to various signals. A research team consisting of
                    Professor Jongmin Kim and Ph.D. candidates Hansol Kang and
                    Dongwon Park from the Department of Life Sciences at POSTECH
                    has developed a multi-signal processing guide RNA.

                  <p>
                    [...] The CRISPR/Cas system, often referred to as "gene
                    scissors," is a technology capable of editing gene sequences
                    to add or delete biological functions. Central to this
                    technology, which is used in several fields such as treating
                    genetic diseases and genetically engineering crops, is a
                    guide RNA that directs the enzyme to edit the gene sequence
                    at a specific location.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While advances in RNA engineering have spurred research into
                    guide RNAs that respond to biological signals, achieving
                    precise control of networks of genes to respond to multiple
                    signals has remained challenging.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this study, the team combined the CRISPR/Cas system with
                    biocomputing to overcome these limitations. Biocomputing is
                    a technology that connects biological components like
                    electronic circuits to program cellular and organismal
                    activities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers implemented a guide RNA gene circuit capable
                    of decision-making based on inputs, similar to a Boolean
                    logic gate, which is one of the fundamental representations
                    of input-output relationships in digitized signal
                    operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This study is significant because it integrates
                    existing systems and technologies to precisely control gene
                    networks, enabling the processing, integration, and response
                    to diverse signals within an organism. This goes beyond the
                    role of guide RNAs in merely directing enzymes to specific
                    locations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Professor Jongmin Kim of POSTECH stated, "The research could
                    enable the precise design of gene therapies based on
                    biological signals within complex genetic circuits involved
                    in disease. RNA molecular engineering allows for the
                    simplicity of software-based structure design which will
                    significantly advance the development of personalized
                    treatments for cancer, genetic disorders, metabolic
                    diseases, and more."

                    Tesla is warning users about a popular "charging hack" that
                    can allegedly result in shorter wait times at select
                    Supercharger stations. The trick, which has been circulating
                    within the Tesla community for at least a few years now,
                    involves wrapping a damp towel around a Supercharger handle
                    when charging. The idea is that the wet rag acts as a
                    cooling agent, tricking temperature sensors inside the
                    handle into thinking the system is running cooler than it
                    actually is.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some claim the hack can increase the charging rate,
                    especially on hot summer days, resulting in a faster charge
                    and less waiting around. Now, Tesla has issued official
                    guidance on the matter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the official Tesla Charging account on X,
                    placing a wet cloth on a Supercharger handle does not
                    increase its charging rate. In does, however, interfere with
                    the system's temperature monitors and could lead to
                    overheating or damage. Tesla advises against the towel trick
                    to help ensure their systems can operate correctly.

                    Tesla's claim that the trick does not work, at least with
                    older V2 Supercharging systems. One Tesla user put a damp
                    cloth over the charging handle on a V2 Supercharger, which
                    increased the charging rate from 60 kilowatts to 95 kW on a
                    hot day. Another user plugged in at two percent stage of
                    charge and reached 147 kW before thermal throttling kicked
                    in at 34 percent and slowed the rate down to 58 kW. Applying
                    a wet rag reportedly drove the charging rate up to 119 kW.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    V3 and newer Superchargers utilize active cooling. According
                    to Inside EV, the towel trick does not really help at all on
                    these systems unless you are charging a Cybertruck.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tesla owners would probably be best served to take the
                    company's advice and not fool with the trick. Saving an
                    extra few minutes simply is not worth the risk of damaging
                    your vehicle or Tesla's equipment.

                    by Ireland's Central Statistics Office (CSO) highlights the
                    explosive growth of energy consumption in data centers. The
                    electricity required by data center operators increased by
                    20 percent between 2022 and 2023, and the total metered
                    energy consumption equaled 21 percent of Ireland's capacity
                    in 2023.

                  <p>
                    Data centers now exceed the energy needs of both urban and
                    rural households, which accounted for 18 percent and 10
                    percent of total metered electricity consumption,
                    respectively. In 2023, the CSO recorded a truly
                    unprecedented increase in power required by Ireland's data
                    centers, rising from 290 gigawatt hours in 2015 to 1,661
                    gigawatt hours, a staggering 473 percent increase.

                    [...] A recent report from the International Energy Agency
                    (IEA) warned about the growing global energy demand by data
                    centers, which could double in just a couple of years. By
                    2026, Ireland may be forced to reserve almost a third of its
                    entire energy supply (32 percent) for data center operators
                    alone.

                    to widespread blackouts and reliability issues. However,

                    Archaeological findings at the renowned Mesolithic site of
                    Star Carr in North Yorkshire suggest that hunter-gatherers
                    maintained an ordered living space by designating specific
                    ‘zones’ for various domestic activities.

                    looked at microscopic evidence from the use of stone tools
                    found inside three structures – potentially cone-like in
                    shape or domed – dating to over 11,000 years ago at the Star
                    Carr site.

                  <p>
                    They found that there was a range of activities that were
                    likely to have taken place inside the ‘home’, including
                    wood, bone, antler, plant, hide, meat, and fish-related
                    work. The researchers then plotted out spatial patterns for
                    these activities to pinpoint where within the dwelling these
                    activities might have occurred.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr Jess Bates, from the University of York’s Department of
                    Archaeology, said: “We found that there were distinct areas
                    for different types of activity, so the messy activity
                    involving butchery, for example, was done in what appears to
                    be a designated space, and separate to the ‘cleaner’ tasks
                    such as crafting bone and wooden objects, tools or jewelry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “This was surprising as hunter-gatherers are known for being
                    very mobile, as they would have to travel out to find food,
                    and yet they have a very organized approach to creating not
                    just a house but a sense of home.

                  <p>
                    [...] Star Carr provides the earliest known evidence of
                    British dwellings and some of the earliest forms of
                    architecture. One of the structures found was believed to be
                    shaped like a cone and was constructed out of wood from
                    felled trees, as well as coverings possibly made from
                    plants, like reeds, or animal hides. There is still very
                    little known about why hunter-gatherers would build such
                    structures and continued to throughout the Mesolithic
                    period.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr. Bates said: “Not only do we now know that
                    hunter-gatherers were constructing these dwellings, but they
                    had a shared group understanding of how to organize tasks
                    within them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “In modern society, we are very attached to our homes both
                    physically and emotionally, but in the deep past communities
                    were highly mobile so it is fascinating to see that despite
                    this there is still this concept of keeping an orderly home
                    space.

                    The Hubble Space Telescope zooms in on a dense ball of
                    millions of stars within a galaxy orbiting the Milky Way.
                    Its ancient origins raise big questions about how galaxies
                    form and grow, [known as ] Globular cluster NGC 2005
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is 162,000 light-years away, in the Large Magellanic
                    Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and visible in
                    the constellation Dorado
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This new image from the Hubble Space Telescope shows an
                    object with mysterious origins that's commonly seen in the
                    Milky Way: a globular cluster, a densely packed and
                    gravitationally bound group of tens of thousands or millions
                    of stars. However, NGC 2005 is actually located in the Large
                    Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a dwarf galaxy close to the Milky
                    Way, and can be easily seen at night from the Southern
                    Hemisphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Globular clusters are thought to be billions of years old.
                    About 150 are known to exist in the halo of the Milky Way.
                    They orbit its center in the opposite direction as most
                    other objects in our galaxy, providing evidence for a theory
                    that they were captured while the Milky Way was merging with
                    other galaxies, according to NASA. That's how astronomers
                    think galaxies evolve and grow. Another clue is that
                    globular clusters host some of the oldest stars in the
                    universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    NGC 2005 is the perfect test case because it exists outside
                    the Milky Way but is close enough to be studied carefully.
                    It's about 750 light-years from the heart of the LMC, the
                    biggest of about 40 dwarf galaxies near the Milky Way. Many
                    of these dwarf galaxies are thought to orbit the Milky Way,
                    though recent data from the Gaia spacecraft suggest that
                    many of them may just be passing by.

                    While NTIA purports to give States the flexibility to choose

                    Researchers from Japan have been working hard to keep their
                    cool—or at least—keep their nanodevices from overheating. By
                    adding a tiny coating of silicon dioxide to micro-sized
                    silicon structures, they were able to show a significant
                    increase in the rate of heat dissipated. This work may lead
                    to smaller and cheaper electronic devices that can pack in
                    more microcircuits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As consumer electronics become ever more compact, while
                    still boasting increased processing power, the need to
                    manage waste heat from microcircuits has grown to become a
                    major concern. Some scientific instruments and nanoscale
                    machines require careful consideration of how localized heat
                    will be shunted out of the device in order to prevent
                    damage. Some cooling occurs when heat is radiated away as
                    electromagnetic waves—similar to how the sun’s power reaches
                    the Earth through the vacuum of space. However, the rate of
                    energy transfer can be too slow to protect the performance
                    of sensitive and densely packed integrated electronic
                    circuits. For the next generation of devices to be
                    developed, novel approaches may need to be established to
                    address this issue of heat transmission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a study recently published in the journal
                    <em>Physical Review Letters</em>, researchers from the
                    Institute of Industrial Science at the University of Tokyo,
                    showed how the rate of radiative heat transfer can be
                    doubled between two micro-scale silicon plates separated by
                    a tiny gap. The key was using a coating of silicon dioxide
                    that created a coupling between the thermal vibrations of
                    the plate at the surface (called phonons) and the photons
                    (which make up the radiation).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “We were able to show both theoretically and experimentally
                    how electromagnetic waves were excited at the interface of
                    the oxide layer that enhanced the rate of heat transfer,”
                    lead author of the study, Saeko Tachikawa says. The small
                    size of the layers compared with the wavelengths of the
                    electromagnetic energy and its attachment to the silicon
                    plate, which carries the energy without loss, allowed the
                    device to surpass the normal limits of heat transfer, and
                    thus cool faster.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because current microelectronics are already based on
                    silicon, the findings of this research could be easily
                    integrated into future generations of semiconductor devices.
                    “Our work provides insight into possible heat dissipation
                    management strategies in the semiconductor industry, along
                    with various other related fields such as nanotech
                    manufacturing,” says senior author, Masahiro Nomura. The
                    research also helps to establish a better fundamental
                    understanding of how heat transfer works at the nanoscale
                    level, since this is still an area of active research.

                    The repository included the private portion of the platform
                    key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was
                    protected by a four-character password, a decision that made
                    it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing
                    curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the
                    corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went
                    largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly
                    researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain
                    incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security
                    experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances
                    offered by Secure Boot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The researchers soon discovered that the compromise of
                    the key was just the beginning of a much bigger supply-chain
                    breakdown that raises serious doubts about the integrity of
                    Secure Boot on more than 300 additional device models from
                    virtually all major device manufacturers. As is the case
                    with the platform key compromised in the 2022 GitHub leak,
                    an additional 21 platform keys contain the strings "DO NOT
                    SHIP" or "DO NOT TRUST."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] People who want to know if their Windows device uses
                    one of the test platform keys can run the following
                    powershell command:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    &gt;
                    [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString((Get-SecureBootUEFI<br />PK).bytes)
                    -match "DO NOT TRUST|DO NOT SHIP"<br />True
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Linux users can detect one of the test certificates by
                    displaying the content of the PK variable:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    $ efi-readvar -v PK<br />Variable PK, length 862<br />PK:
                    List 0, type X509<br />Signature 0, size 834, owner

                    NOT TRUST - AMI Test PK<br />Issuer:<br />CN=DO NOT TRUST -
                    AMI Test PK
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There's little that users of an affected device can do other
                    than install a patch if one becomes available from the
                    manufacturer. In the meantime, it's worth remembering that
                    Secure Boot has a history of not living up to its promises.
                    The most recent reminder came late last year with the
                    disclosure of LogoFAIL, a constellation of image-parsing
                    vulnerabilities in UEFI libraries from just about every
                    device maker. By replacing the legitimate logo images with
                    identical-looking ones that have been specially crafted to
                    exploit these bugs, LogoFAIL makes it possible to execute
                    malicious code at the most sensitive stage of the boot
                    process, which is known as DXE, short for Driver Execution
                    Environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "My takeaway is 'yup, [manufacturers] still screw up Secure
                    Boot, this time due to lazy key management,' but it wasn't
                    obviously a change in how I see the world (secure boot being
                    a fig leaf security measure in many cases)," HD Moore, a
                    firmware security expert and CTO and co-founder at runZero,
                    said after reading the Binarly report. "The story is that
                    the whole UEFI supply chain is a hot mess and hasn't
                    improved much since 2016."

                    Vivalt doesn't view the dip in hours spent working as a
                    negative outcome of the experiment, either. On the contrary,
                    according to Vivalt. "People are doing more stuff, and if
                    the results say people value having more leisure time — that
                    this is what increases their well-being — that's positive."

                    In other words, the cash transfers gave recipients more
                    autonomy over how they spent their time, according to
                    Vivalt.

                    "It gives people the choice to make their own decisions
                    about what they want to do. In that sense, it necessarily
                    improves their well-being," she said.

                    Researchers expected that participants would ultimately earn
                    higher wages by taking on better-paid work, but that
                    scenario didn't pan out. "They thought that if you can
                    search longer for work because you have more of a cushion,
                    you can afford to wait for better jobs, or maybe you quit
                    bad jobs," Vivalt said. "But we don't find any effects on
                    the quality of employment whatsoever."

                    Cash transfer recipients experienced a 26% increase in the
                    number of hospitalizations in the last year, compared with
                    the average control recipient. The average recipient also
                    experienced a 10% increase in the probability of having
                    visited an emergency department in the last year.

                    expectations until more is known. Non-biological processes
                    could have created the leopard splotches, such as mineral
                    deposits from past flows of water. In the announcement, the

                    And, crucially, to move up the scale, the sample (from a
                    rock named Cheyava Falls) must be closely analyzed in labs
                    on Earth, with far more instruments than the distant,

                    In a ferroelectric material, positive and negative charges
                    spontaneously head to different sides, or poles. Upon the
                    application of an external electric field, those charges
                    switch sides, reversing the polarization. Switching the
                    polarization can be used to encode digital information, and
                    that information will be nonvolatile, or stable over time.
                    It won’t change unless an electric field is applied. For a
                    ferroelectric to have broad application to electronics, all
                    of this needs to happen at room temperature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new ferroelectric material <a
                      href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/physicists-engineer-ferroelectricity-in-boron-nitride-0915"
                      >reported in <em>Science</em> in 2021</a
                    >
                    is based on atomically thin sheets of boron nitride that are
                    stacked parallel to each other, a configuration that doesn’t
                    exist in nature. In bulk boron nitride, the individual
                    layers of boron nitride are instead rotated by 180 degrees.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It turns out that when an electric field is applied to this
                    parallel stacked configuration, one layer of the new boron
                    nitride material slides over the other, slightly changing
                    the positions of the boron and nitrogen atoms. For example,
                    imagine that each of your hands is composed of only one
                    layer of cells. The new phenomenon is akin to pressing your
                    hands together then slightly shifting one above the other.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “So the miracle is that by sliding the two layers a few
                    angstroms, you end up with radically different electronics,”
                    says Ashoori. The diameter of an atom is about 1 angstrom.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another miracle: “nothing wears out in the sliding,” Ashoori
                    continues. That’s why the new transistor could be switched
                    100 billion times without degrading. Compare that to the
                    memory in a flash drive made with conventional materials.
                    “Each time you write and erase a flash memory, you get some
                    degradation,” says Ashoori. “Over time, it wears out, which
                    means that you have to use some very sophisticated methods
                    for distributing where you’re reading and writing on the
                    chip.” The new material could make those steps obsolete.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yasuda, the co-first author of the current
                    <em>Science</em> paper, applauds the collaborations involved
                    in the work. Among them, “we [Jarillo-Herrero’s team] made
                    the material and, together with Ray [Ashoori] and [co-first
                    author] Evan [Zalys-Geller], we measured its characteristics
                    in detail. That was very exciting.” Says Ashoori, “many of
                    the techniques in my lab just naturally applied to work that
                    was going on in the lab next door. It’s been a lot of fun.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ashoori notes that “there’s a lot of interesting physics
                    behind this” that could be explored. For example, “if you
                    think about the two layers sliding past each other, where
                    does that sliding start?” In addition, says Yasuda, could
                    the ferroelectricity be triggered with something other than
                    electricity, like an optical pulse? And is there a
                    fundamental limit to the amount of switches the material can
                    make?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Challenges remain. For example, the current way of producing
                    the new ferroelectrics is difficult and not conducive to
                    mass manufacturing. “We made a single transistor as a
                    demonstration. If people could grow these materials on the
                    wafer scale, we could create many, many more,” says Yasuda.
                    He notes that different groups are already working to that
                    end.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Concludes Ashoori, “There are a few problems. But if you
                    solve them, this material fits in so many ways into
                    potential future electronics. It’s very exciting.”

                  <p>
                    On Monday, it initially seemed like the beginning of the end
                    for Intel's desktop CPU instability woes — the company
                    confirmed a patch is coming in mid-August that should
                    address the "root cause" of exposure to elevated voltage.
                    But if your 13th or 14th Gen Intel Core processor is already
                    crashing, that patch apparently won't fix it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Citing unnamed sources, Tom's Hardware reports that any
                    degradation of the processor is irreversible, and an Intel
                    spokesperson did not deny that when we asked. Intel is
                    "confident" the patch will keep it from happening in the
                    first place. (As another preventative measure, you should
                    update your motherboard BIOS ASAP.) But if your defective
                    CPU has been damaged, your best option is to replace it
                    instead of tweaking BIOS settings to try and alleviate the
                    problems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And, Intel confirms, too-high voltages aren't the only
                    reason some of these chips are failing. Intel spokesperson
                    Thomas Hannaford confirms it's a primary cause, but the
                    company is still investigating. Intel community manager Lex
                    Hoyos also revealed some instability reports can be traced
                    back to an oxidization manufacturing issue that was fixed at
                    an unspecified date last year.

                    I'd never heard of this before but I saw someone I know post
                    about it... upset that it existed and lots of people
                    commented about being upset. More searching found more
                    people upset including a few saying that it should be
                    "illegal" and penalties need to exist for doing something
                    like this. I did a little more searching and found that at
                    some point, it was something done on TikTok by someone and
                    it got a following. I then found an online version like
                    those other online versions of Bibles. The original post I
                    saw had a screenshot of a page, which I figured was just a
                    prop or photoshopped but it turns out, someone has used
                    ChatGPT to do a Gen-Z slang translation that can be
                    purchased in physical form. Evidently, some people are
                    buying them and taking them to church. In some discussion, I
                    saw people saying that this might be a way to reach some
                    younger people, as a positive.

                  <p>
                    Anyway... I think it's pretty hilarious. I'm sure a bunch of
                    folks will be gasping and clutching pearls. I figured I'd
                    make a post as a PSA in case others haven't heard about it
                    before (like me).

                  <p>
                    Recently, my father and I took a trip out to a local
                    provincial park for a weekend of camping.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last time I had been camping happened to coincide with the
                    period of time that I was starting to gain curiosity about
                    amateur radio. I vividly recall being out there wishing I
                    had a radio that I could use to communicate from the
                    campsite.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, to appease my past self, the present-tense
                    radio-license-having version of me took my HF rig along to
                    make some contacts.

                    Justice Michael Lee handed down his judgement in the class
                    action against widely-used herbicide Roundup on Thursday
                    afternoon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The case, launched by Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, claims
                    Roundup's active ingredient glyphosate caused the cancer of
                    more than 800 Australian non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Justice Lee ruled there is not enough current evidence to
                    say glyphosate is carcinogenic and capable of causing
                    non-Hodgkin lymphoma in humans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The judge only needed to consider the question of general
                    causation – not the specific claims of lead applicant Kelvin
                    McNickle or the other class action group members.
                  </p>
                  <p>Justice Lee ordered the proceedings be dismissed.</p>
                  <p>
                    Bayer, which acquired Roundup's producer Monsanto in 2018,
                    has previously stated glyphosate-based herbicides have been
                    rigorously tested in hundreds of studies and it is safe when
                    used as directed.

                    In addition, comparisons of the planet’s temperature map
                    with complex 3D atmospheric models demonstrated that this
                    temperature contrast is stronger than expected for a
                    cloud-free atmosphere. This suggests that the planet’s
                    nightside is shrouded in a thick layer of clouds that blocks
                    much of the infrared radiation that would otherwise be
                    observed. Unlike Earth’s water clouds, the clouds on this
                    extremely hot planet resemble dust and are composed of rocks
                    and minerals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Surprisingly, despite this thick layer of clouds, the
                    JTEC-ERS team also detected clear signals of water on the
                    planet’s nightside. This allowed them to determine, for the
                    first time, the cloud height and thickness, unveiling their
                    unusual altitude and density compared to Earth’s clouds. The
                    researchers also detected wind-driven mixing, called
                    “chemical disequilibrium,” that swiftly transports gas
                    throughout the planet’s atmosphere and results in uniform
                    atmospheric chemistry.

                    The countdown progressed normally, and by T-3 seconds, all
                    the engines were up and running and operating at 100 percent
                    power.

                    A former Shuttle flight director, Wayne Hale,
                    <a
                      href="https://waynehale.wordpress.com/2014/10/26/sts-93-we-dont-need-any-more-of-those/"

                    the subsequent events: "Exactly when it happened is not
                    clear, but on the right engine, the gold-plated pin from LOX
                    post 32 in row 13 came shooting out. Just like a bullet, it
                    went through the narrow part of the converging nozzle and
                    flew out into the nozzle extension."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This could have been disastrous – the LOX post had been
                    pinned for a reason and could have failed and let LOX flow
                    into the engine, resulting in explosion. "Failure of the LOX
                    post was considered a CRIT 1 failure – loss of vehicle and
                    crew 'promptly,'" Hale wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Or the nozzle extension could have failed. Another CRIT 1
                    failure. According to Hale, it had been calculated that if
                    five adjacent cooling tubes in the nozzle extension were
                    split, there would not be enough cooling and a burn through
                    would occur. As it was, only three tubes were breached as
                    the bullet-shaped LOX pin hit the side of the right nozzle
                    extension.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The immediate effect was a hydrogen leak from the nozzle. It
                    was not huge, but enough for the engine's controller to
                    increase the oxidizer flow, increasing the turbine
                    temperature approximately halfway to the point where an
                    engine would be automatically shut down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It took the booster officer and his team around a minute to
                    realize something was amiss with the engine – not for want
                    of attention but because they had their hands full with
                    another problem. Remember that loose SRB connection? It
                    resulted in an alarm on the console. There were two
                    hydraulic systems on each SRB. If both failed, the SRB would
                    not be steerable. Another sudden CRIT 1 failure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And then there was that chafed wire and the potential short
                    circuit. As the Shuttle lifted off, the commander, Eileen
                    Collins, called "Fuel Cell PH."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hale wrote that the call indicated that one of the fuel
                    cells might be failing: "It's the Kaboom Case, Flight."
                    However, although the master alarm onboard Columbia was
                    wailing, the fuel cell had not actually failed. Instead, one
                    of the AC buses had shorted out. The affected part of the
                    circuit had been automatically shut down, and the erroneous
                    alarm was caused by suddenly unpowered instrumentation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One effect of the short was a loss of power to the Space
                    Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) controllers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Hale: "The A computer on the Center SSME lost
                    power, never to be recovered. The B computer (DCU B)
                    immediately took control and the engine ran on normally."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Except it wasn't running normally. The A channel pressure
                    transducer dropped offline, meaning that the B computer only
                    had the B transducer, which was reading slightly high – in
                    this case, 12 psi high. Automatically, the B computer
                    throttled back the center engine. Not hugely, but enough to
                    partially offset the shortfall of LOX caused by the nozzle
                    leak on the right engine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The engine had lost its B computer, but the A computer
                    continued working, and the engine, with the leak, carried on
                    running.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "How lucky we were," Hale said. "Instead of being 200 or
                    more fps short at MECO, possibly leading to an abort landing
                    or requiring two tons of OMS propellant to make up, we wound
                    up being only 15 fps short, well within the capability of
                    the OMS budget."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The mission itself was successful, and the Chandra X-ray
                    observatory, which is

                    service the Hubble Space Telescope.

                    As for the issues seen during the launch, NASA

                    that the wiring problem was likely caused by workers
                    "inadvertently stepping on it," and the problem had likely
                    been there since Columbia was manufactured. And the pin?
                    Apparently, it had never passed any acceptance testing.
                    STS-93 was the last flight of that generation of SSMEs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The next upgrade to the SSMEs was to build a more robust
                    channel wall nozzle extension," Hale said. "The shuttle
                    program ended before that was done."

                    While Shannon's "yikes" will go down in spaceflight history,
                    we'll leave the last word to Hale.

                    Summing ASCII Encoded Integers on Haswell at the Speed of
                    memcpy turned out more popular than I expected, which
                    inspired me to take on another challenge on HighLoad:
                    Counting uint8s. I'm currently only #13 on the leaderboard,
                    ~7% behind #1, but I already learned some interesting
                    things. In this post I'll describe my complete solution
                    (skip to that) including a surprising memory read pattern
                    that achieves up to ~30% higher transfer rates on fully
                    memory bound, single core workloads compared to naive
                    sequential access, while apparently not being widely known
                    (skip to that).

                    The automaker announced the pivot in an earnings call this
                    week, with CEO Mary Barra citing the Origin's "unique
                    design" as creating too much "regulatory uncertainty." That
                    design was indeed unusual, with no immediately obvious front
                    or rear, and not a single spot for a human driver.

                    Instead of the Origin, GM's Cruise autonomous driving
                    division will refocus on modifying existing Chevy Bolt EVs
                    for self-driving capabilities. A new generation of
                    autonomous Bolts is slated for production in 2025, and Barra
                    says going this route will reduce costs per vehicle.

                    GM's chief financial officer Paul Jacobson says the company
                    "might" revisit Origin down the road, but currently the
                    efforts are "really going to be focused" on the Bolt.

                    A team of marine biologists and ecotoxicologists affiliated
                    with several institutions in Brazil has found cocaine in
                    muscle and liver samples collected from Brazilian Sharpnose
                    sharks harvested off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. Their
                    study,

                      href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0048969724049477"
                      >published</a
                    >
                    in the journal <i>Science of the Total Environment</i>,
                    highlights the potential impact of the presence of illicit
                    drugs in marine environments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Prior research has suggested that much cocaine winds up in
                    the ocean via wastewater from sewage systems, drainage from
                    labs and packages abandoned by traffickers attempting to
                    prevent discovery. What is not known is how long the drug
                    persists in the sea and what impact it has on ocean life.
                    For this new study, the research team tested Brazilian
                    Sharpnose sharks, a small variety that makes its home in the
                    shallow waters along many of Brazil's coastal areas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers purchased 13 of the sharks from local
                    fishermen. Each was dissected in the lab, where the team
                    also collected muscle and liver samples and assessed them
                    with tandem mass spectrometry. They found cocaine in all the
                    samples at concentrations approximately 100 times higher
                    than observed in any other marine animal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers suggest their findings are just a starting
                    point regarding research into the presence of cocaine in the
                    sea. They note that it is not known what sort of impact the
                    cocaine might have on the sharks. They do not know, for
                    example, if it impacts their behavior, as it does humans, or
                    if it impacts other functions such as their reproductive
                    abilities.

                    A separate "front line" in this confrontation is the
                    development and implementation of SoM [System on Module]
                    with Programmable Logic. This post is dedicated to one small
                    "battle," on the example of which we want to show why, in
                    our opinion, China could win this "war."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since the announcement in 2019 by Xilinx (which then bore
                    this name without a proud three-letter prefix), Versal ACAP
                    (Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform) chips were
                    inaccessible to developers—the first development boards cost
                    tens of thousands of U.S. dollars, and the difficulty of
                    developing your own board for this chip would scare off
                    anyone other than Tony Stark.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A lot of water flowed, and a lot of developers' tears were
                    shed, but a silicon Versal is just as unavailable as The
                    Palace of Versailles: the cheapest kit from AMD–VEK280 is
                    sold by the official suppliers for $7K, excluding delivery
                    and customs clearance. The classic argument in the style of
                    "if you don't have money for an iron door, you don't need
                    it" does not always work in the field of R&amp;D—a rare
                    developer will refuse to study a top-end chip at the expense
                    of his employer, but even with this approach, the cost is
                    too high.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The problem is that the announcement of AMD Xilinx has
                    so far remained an announcement, but the developers from
                    Alinx, the Chinese company, did not waste any time. This
                    company already is known for its inexpensive development
                    boards with Zynq‑7000 and Ultrascale+ on board, not much
                    different from SoM. Now they not only promised, but also
                    mass-produced the SoM V100 with the XCVE2302-SFVA784-1LP-E-S
                    chip (Versal AI Edge family) for $750 [1].
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There is, of course, a fly in the V100 ointment. The
                    developers from Alinx were so inspired by Kria that they
                    also used "legendary" Samtec connectors "well-liked" by all
                    designers and engineers. Who among us hasn't drilled them
                    from the side with the thinnest drill, forgetting to route
                    that very necessary pin right in the middle in the inner
                    row? However, to achieve the required transmission speeds
                    with a compact size, there is hardly an alternative to
                    Samtec connectors.
