                    In a nutshell: Mozilla is seemingly on a journey to change
                    the internet again, but it will not get there with Firefox.
                    The open-source browser is barely mentioned throughout the
                    company's latest corporate manifesto, where AI algorithms
                    have become the real focus of the show.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the recently published
                    <a href="https://stateof.mozilla.org/"
                      >State of Mozilla for 2023</a
                    >, the open-source foundation made some bold statements
                    about its plans for the future. The organization aims to
                    build a better internet "by the people, for the people,"
                    countering the overwhelming influence of Big Tech
                    corporations with open data and AI services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The updated State of Mozilla is essentially designed to be a
                    company manifesto written in corporate lingo but it also
                    comes with the latest financial statements related to 2022
                    results, providing some interesting food for thought about
                    how and where the organization is spending its money.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mozilla's CEO, Mitchell Baker, received a substantial
                    compensation increase, as stated in the document, going from
                    $5,591,406 (2021) to $6,903,089 in 2022. Baker mentioned
                    that the organization is clearly moving in the right
                    direction but needs to do more and have a larger impact on
                    the market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Mozilla's CEO is being paid a lot more while Firefox
                    keeps losing users, and someone has
                    <a
                      href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5053290/mozilla-2023-annual-report-ceo-pay-skyrockets-while-firefox-marketshare-nosedives"
                      >suggested</a
                    >
                    that the organization's plan is now to fully transition away
                    from the open-source browser. Mozilla is increasing its pile
                    of financial assets, and Baker has clearly stated that the
                    organization is ready to make "difficult choices" when it
                    comes to shutting down unprofitable projects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, what future is Mozilla trying to build for itself and
                    internet users? The foundation is pushing the idea of a
                    trustworthy AI, improved ML algorithms with rich data, and
                    privacy prioritization. Mozilla still wants to put people
                    ahead of profit, the company's CEO said, but also take more
                    risks and move quickly in the growing AI market.

                    "Fog involves a lot of physics processes so it requires a
                    computer model that can better represent all these
                    processes," Pu said. "Because fog is clouds near the ground,
                    it requires a high-resolution model to resolve it, so we
                    need models at a very fine scale, which are computationally
                    very expensive. The current models (relatively coarser in
                    resolution) are not capable of resolving the fog processes,
                    and we need to improve the models for better fog
                    prediction."

                    Located bout 50 miles southeast of Salt Lake City, Heber
                    Valley is nestled behind the Wasatch Mountains and framed by
                    two major reservoirs on the Provo River.

                    serving as a moisture source. The seven-week study window
                    covered the time of year when Heber Valley is the foggiest.

                    A security report can take away a developer from fixing a
                    really annoying bug. because a security issue is always more
                    important than other bugs. If the report turned out to be
                    crap, we did not improve security and we missed out time on
                    fixing bugs or developing a new feature. Not to mention how
                    it drains you on energy having to deal with rubbish.

                Often wannabe security consultants will take the output of an
                LLM and modify it with their own language, thus intentionally or
                unintentionally obscuring some of the telltale warning signs of
                LLM-generated bunk.

                    mass production in the second half of 2024, is now expected
                    to have only limited production by that time. Samsung is
                    apparently scaling back its Texas operation due to uncertain
                    financial factors, including CHIPS Act subsidies and the

                    production in favor of a smaller output levels until 2025.

                    mind. Although the U.S. has seemingly achieved a so-called
                    soft landing and has avoided a true recession, other parts
                    of the world aren't so lucky. Samsung is still reeling from

                    $200 billion investment in the U.S., which could spell
                    success or disaster for the company.

                    The condition - which around 70,000 people in the UK are
                    thought to be living with - is when symptoms of dementia
                    develop before the age of 65.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study challenges the notion that genetics are the sole
                    cause of the condition, researchers have said.

                    Targeting the factors they identified could help reduce the

                    A list of 15 factors - which is similar to that for
                    late-onset dementia - includes alcohol abuse, stroke, social
                    isolation and hearing impairment.

                  <p>
                    Those with a higher formal education were seen to be at less

                  <p>
                    The study "breaks new ground" and could "herald a new era"
                    for interventions to reduce new cases, said Dr Janice
                    Ranson, one of the study's authors.

                  <p>
                    The most common feature of dementia is memory loss, but
                    other symptoms include changes in behaviour, and becoming
                    lost in familiar places.
                  </p>

                    [...] The study, conducted by scientists from the UK and the
                    Netherlands, is the "largest and most robust study of its
                    kind ever conducted", one of it's authors, Professor David
                    Llewellyn, has said.

                  <p>
                    [...] Prof Llewellyn said there was still much to learn but
                    the study "reveals that we may be able to take action to
                    reduce risk of this debilitating condition".

                    <strong>Rebecca Simon</strong>:  A lot of people ask me
                    about the pirate accent: "Aaarr matey!" That accent we think
                    of comes from the actor Robert Newton who played Long John
                    Silver in the 1950 film

                    the end of the day, pirates were sailors. People ask about
                    what they wore, what they ate, thinking it's somehow
                    different. But the reality is it was the same as other
                    sailors. They might have had better clothes and better food
                    because of how often they robbed other ships.

                    <strong>Rebecca Simon</strong>: There were several reasons
                    why piracy really began to die down in the 1720s. One was an
                    increase in the Royal Navy presence so the seas were a lot
                    more heavily patrolled and it was becoming more difficult to
                    make a living as a pirate. Colonial governors and colonists
                    were no longer supporting pirates the way they once had, so
                    a lot of pirates were now losing their alliances and
                    protections. A lot of major pirate leaders who had been
                    veterans of the

                  <p>
                    It was just becoming too risky. And by 1730 a lot more wars
                    were breaking out, which required people who could sail and
                    fight. Pirates were offered pardons if they agreed to become
                    a privateer, basically a government-sanctioned mercenary at
                    sea where they were contracted to attack specific enemies.
                    As payment they got to keep about 80 percent of what they
                    stole. A lot of pirates decided that was more lucrative and
                    more stable.

                    [...] In her 30 years living in the Amazon, Dr Marmontel
                    never imagined she would see it so dry. She is shocked by
                    how quickly the climate is changing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It was like a slap in the face. Because it's the first time
                    that I see and I feel what's happening to the Amazon," she
                    says.

                  <p>
                    "We always say these animals are sentinels because they feel
                    first what's going to come to us. It's happening to them,
                    it's going to happen to us."

                  <p>For Oliveira, too, this year has been a wake up call.</p>
                  <p>
                    "We know that we are very much to blame for this, we haven't
                    been paying attention, we haven't been defending our mother
                    Earth. She is screaming for help," he says.

              <p>Are SSBs Still Useful?</p>
              <p>
                Had SSBs come into existence in the mid-1990s when the Internet
                first became popular, they would have been a valuable tool for
                those trying to grasp the difference between between local
                applications and online resources. But nearly a quarter of the
                way into the 21st century, complete newcomers to computers are a
                much smaller minority than they once were. After trying Ice and
                Kumo for a week, I found SSBs convenient, but remain uncertain
                whether to make them a standard tool on my desktop. While SSBs
                make for a better user experience, is their efficiency that much
                more efficient than the dichotomy I lived with years? For better
                or worse, like most people, I am used to the dichotomy and it
                would be inefficient to change, even for a more economical
                arrangement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps SSBs make more sense on a network or in a business where
                their isolation provides another layer of security. Or perhaps
                the time for SSBs is past and there's a reason browsers have
                tried to implement them, and then discarded them.

                    During the pandemic, a third of people in the UK reported
                    that their trust in science had increased,
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0278169"

                    But 7% said that it had decreased. Why is there such variety
                    of responses?

                  <p>
                    For many years, it was thought that the main reason some
                    people reject science was a simple deficit of knowledge and
                    a mooted(*) fear of the unknown. Consistent with this, many
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662506070159"
                      >surveys reported</a
                    >
                    that attitudes to science are more positive among those
                    people who know more of the textbook science.

                  <p>
                    But if that were indeed the core problem, the remedy would
                    be simple: inform people about the facts. This strategy,
                    which dominated science communication through much of the
                    later part of the 20th century, has, however,

                    [...] Recent evidence has revealed that people who reject or
                    distrust science are not especially well informed about it,
                    but more importantly, they typically believe that they do

                  <p>
                    [...] A common quandary for much science communication may
                    in fact be that it appeals to those already engaged with
                    science. Which may be why you read this.

                  <p>
                    That said, the new science of communication suggests it is
                    certainly worth trying to reach out to those who are
                    disengaged.

                    To better understand this shift from belief to disbelief and
                    children's experiences of it, Mills and her colleagues
                    interviewed 48 six- to 15-year-olds who had stopped
                    believing in Santa and 44 of their parents, plus a further
                    383 adults.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The<a href="https://osf.io/3hyxa"> research</a>, which has
                    not yet been peer reviewed, found that for most children,
                    disbelief crept in gradually about the age of eight –
                    although some three- or four-year-olds had convinced
                    themselves that Santa wasn't real, while other children
                    believed in him until they were 15 or 16. In many cases, it
                    was testimony from other disbelievers that finally crushed
                    their faith.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mills said: "They may have had some scepticism based on
                    logical reasoning – like how can Santa Claus really get
                    around the world in one night? – but what pushes them over
                    the edge is a classmate at school saying he's not real."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Roughly a third of children and half of adults reported some
                    negative emotions upon falling for the rumour that Santa
                    doesn't exist. Although these feelings were usually mild and
                    short-lived, about 10% of adults reported longer-lasting
                    sadness or reduced trust in their parents as a result.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Such feelings tended to be associated with learning abruptly
                    or being told directly that Santa isn't real, making this
                    discovery at an older age, and having parents who had
                    strongly supported the existence of Santa, eg by making
                    videos of him in their living room or leaving trails of
                    glitter on the floor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, there were also many children who reported feeling
                    happy or relieved when they gave up their faith. "It was
                    like they'd solved some sort of riddle," Mills said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although Santa clearly frowns on such behaviour, he will be
                    relieved to hear that, regardless of their experience, the
                    vast majority of sceptical adults and children said that
                    they would continue the Santa tradition with their own
                    children, or were already doing so.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for how Santa deniers should handle Santa-related
                    questions when they crop up, Mills suggested listening
                    closely to what the child is asking, before answering. If
                    they want to know how Santa fits down narrow chimneys, or
                    gets into houses that don't have one, they may not be ready
                    to give up the idea of Santa. Consider asking the child what
                    they think, talking about what "some people" believe, or
                    simply say "that's an interesting question".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If asked directly whether Santa is real, caregivers could
                    also use a deflecting question, such as "what do you think?"
                    and see how the child discusses it themselves. "There can
                    sometimes be some tension, because they want to keep
                    believing in the magic, but they also want to know the
                    truth," said Mills. Turning it back on the child can help
                    caregivers assess their needs at that point in time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When Mills was asked this question by her own children, she
                    initially deflected, but when they said, "I want to know the
                    truth" – Mills told them. "They were very proud of
                    themselves and they celebrated."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some children may also be more sensitive about being lied to
                    than others, she added. One of the adults she interviewed
                    said they had felt very betrayed by their parents because
                    they had taught them not to lie, but had been doing it
                    themselves. Mills said: "In such cases, parents can soften
                    the blow by acknowledging their child's feelings and talking
                    about why they have included Santa in their holiday
                    traditions."

                    their engine in their research paper. However, based on
                    previous scientific estimates, the explosion of combustible
                    gases can convert nearly 80% of chemical energy into kinetic
                    energy. This is a significant improvement compared to
                    conventional turbofan engines, which typically achieve
                    20-30% efficiencies and rely on slow and gentle combustion.

                  <p>
                    Zhang's team claims that their design, which integrates
                    rotational and straight-line detonation across a wide speed
                    range, is a "world first" testament to Chinese ingenuity.
                    "This solution has obvious advantages and is expected to
                    improve the optimal thermodynamic cycle efficiency in nearly
                    all speed ranges, bringing a revolutionary change in
                    aerospace propulsion," the researchers said.

                  <p>
                    According to Zhang's team, the transition to the new
                    detonation engine was challenging due to the two operating
                    modes. As the speed approached Mach 7, the rotating
                    detonation mode became unsustainable. Therefore, the oblique
                    detonation mode had to be ignited quickly. According to the
                    authors, there are some potential solutions to the problem.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One is to decrease the incoming air speed from Mach 7 to
                    Mach 4 or even lower. This will allow the fuel to heat up
                    adequately for auto-ignition. Another solution is to make
                    slight adjustments to the engine's internal structure, such
                    as modifying the diameter of the circular platform and the
                    angle of the shock wave tilt. These modifications could have
                    an impact on the engine's overall performance.

                      >Firefly Green Fuels</a
                    >, a UK-based company, has developed a new form of jet fuel
                    that is entirely fossil-free and made from human waste. The
                    company worked with experts at Cranfield University to
                    confirm that the fuel they developed had a 90 percent lower
                    carbon footprint than what is used in aviation today,
                    according to the BBC. Tests by independent regulators
                    validated that what Firefly Green Fuels has developed is
                    nearly identical to standard A1 jet fuel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2021, the company received a £2 million grant from the
                    Department of Transport to continue developing its
                    sustainable aviation fuel. Although it's not yet available
                    commercially, the company says it is on track to bringing
                    its fuel to the global market and it will have its first
                    commercial plant operating within 5 years. The company has
                    already inked a partnership with the budget airline Wizz Air
                    — the name of the company and the source of its potential
                    combustibles could scarcely be a more perfect pairing — to
                    supply it with fuel starting in 2028.

                  <p>
                    It currently sources its waste from water companies in the
                    UK and takes the refined sewage through a process called
                    hydrothermal liquefaction, which converts the liquid waste
                    into a sludge or crude oil. Solid by-products can also be
                    made into crop fertilizer. The company claims that the
                    carbon intensity of the whole process — which measures how
                    much carbon is needed to produce energy — is 7.97 grams of
                    carbon dioxide per megajoule (gCO²e/MJ). Comparatively, the
                    ICCT says carbon intensity recorded for jet fuel ranges from
                    85 to 95 gCO²e/MJ.

                    [...] The achievement of carbon neutrality in our airspaces
                    has been a longtime goal for regulators and leaders in
                    Europe and the US. While EVs have made headway in the car
                    industry, it might be a while before we see battery powered
                    commercial jets. So in the meantime, solutions for creating
                    more environmentally-friendly jet fuel are welcome.

                    Researchers have developed a new, lightweight foam made from
                    carbon nanotubes that, when used as a helmet liner, absorbed
                    the kinetic energy caused by an impact almost 30 times
                    better than liners currently used in US military helmets.
                    The foam could prevent or significantly reduce the
                    likelihood of concussion in military personnel and
                    sportspeople.

                    (TBI) is one of the major causes of permanent disability and
                    death. Injury statistics show that the majority of TBIs, of
                    which concussion is a subtype, are associated with oblique
                    impacts, which subject the brain to a combination of linear
                    and rotational kinetic energy forces and cause shearing of
                    the delicate brain tissue.

                    carefully arranged layers of carbon cylinders one atom thick
                    – and their exceptional shock-absorbing capabilities.
                    Current helmets attempt to reduce rotational motion by
                    allowing a sliding motion between the wearer's head and the
                    helmet during impact. However, the researchers say this
                    movement doesn't dissipate energy in shear and can jam when
                    severely compressed following a blow. Instead, their novel
                    foam doesn't rely on sliding layers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    VACNT foam sidesteps this shortcoming via its unique
                    deformation mechanism. Under compression, the VACNTs undergo
                    collective sequentially progressive buckling, from increased
                    compliance at low shear strain levels to a stiffening
                    response at high strain levels. The formed compression
                    buckles unfold completely, enabling the VACNT foam to
                    accommodate large shear strains before returning to a near
                    initial state when the load is removed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers found that at 25% precompression, the foam
                    exhibited almost 30 times higher energy dissipation in shear
                    – up to 50% shear strain – than polyurethane-based
                    elastomeric foams of similar density.

                In a little over 1 month's time we will have been active as a
                site for 10 years. Hopefully by then we will also have created
                the new site and will be looking at another 10 years or more
                ahead of us. That still requires some more work from everyone as
                it is the community who will be deciding how the site is run,
                what the new policies will be, what subjects are discussed and
                how we grow our community in the future. The entire Board will
                consist of volunteers elected from the community by the

                    Both the Hadza and Yao people have their own unique
                    languages, and sounds from them may have been incorporated
                    into their calls. But there is more to it than that. The
                    Hadza often hunt animals when hunting for honey. Therefore,
                    the Hadza don't want their calls to be recognized as human,
                    or else the prey they are after might sense a threat and
                    flee. This may be why they use whistles to communicate with
                    honeyguides—by sounding like birds, they can both attract
                    the honeyguides and stalk prey without being detected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In contrast, the Yao do not hunt mammals, relying mostly on
                    agriculture and fishing for food. This, along with the fact
                    that they try to avoid potentially dangerous creatures such
                    as lions, rhinos, and elephants, and can explain why they
                    use recognizably human vocalizations to call honeyguides.
                    Human voices may scare these animals away, so Yao honey
                    hunters can safely seek honey with their honeyguide
                    partners. These findings show that cultural diversity has
                    had a significant influence on calls to honeyguides.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While animals might not literally speak our language, the
                    honeyguide is just one of many species that has its own way
                    of communicating with us. They can even learn our cultural
                    traditions.

                    The Reuters piece is quite long, and earns its length with
                    an incredible wealth of damning receipts, including internal
                    Tesla communications making clear that the company has known
                    about its own shoddy work for a long time, even as it
                    deceived investors, regulators, and drivers. [...]

                    All the upside-down incentives and warped prerogatives of
                    the startup world are on display here (including a
                    preference for lying and monkeying with data over actually
                    doing good work). They're also, in turn, mere appendages of
                    a deeper and more profound decadence. In 2023, discovery,
                    exploration, and invention are just vibes you rent, by
                    investing in a future-costumed effort to ignore all of
                    what's already been learned and pretend "making a car that
                    works" (or tunnels, or spaceships, or social media) is a new
                    frontier. What matters isn't whether any of this has been
                    done before, and more authentically, and well enough to be
                    built upon—what matters is that this particular rich
                    man-child hasn't done it yet, from scratch, for himself and
                    for his own dream of being The Most Special Boy. In the
                    absence of any real opportunity to envision a brighter
                    future, you sign up to support some inheritance goober's
                    personal fantasy camp by dumping money into his company or
                    buying his stupid-looking car. In this way, you are meant to
                    understand, you have participated in the great grand
                    adventure of discovering tomorrow.

                    [...] "They aren't really Red Hat any longer, they're IBM,"
                    Perens writes in the note he shared with
                    <em>The Register</em>. "And of course they stopped
                    distributing CentOS, and for a long time they've done
                    something that I feel violates the GPL, and

                    >
                    was about another company doing the exact same thing: They
                    tell you that if you are a RHEL customer, you can't disclose
                    the GPL source for security patches that RHEL makes, because
                    they won't allow you to be a customer any longer. IBM
                    employees assert that they are still feeding patches to the
                    upstream open source project, but of course they aren't
                    required to do so.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This has gone on for a long time, and only the fact that
                    Red Hat made a public distribution of CentOS (essentially an
                    unbranded version of RHEL) made it tolerable. Now IBM isn't
                    doing that any longer. So I feel that IBM has gotten
                    everything it wants from the open source developer community
                    now, and we've received something of a middle finger from
                    them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Obviously CentOS was important to companies as well, and
                    they are running for the wings in adopting Rocky Linux. I
                    could wish they went to a Debian derivative, but OK. But we
                    have a number of straws on the Open Source camel's back.
                    Will one break it?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another straw burdening the Open Source camel, Perens
                    writes, "is that Open Source has completely failed to serve
                    the common person. For the most part, if they use us at all
                    they do so through a proprietary software company's systems,
                    like Apple iOS or Google Android, both of which use Open
                    Source for infrastructure but the apps are mostly
                    proprietary. The common person doesn't know about Open
                    Source, they don't know about the freedoms we promote which
                    are increasingly in their interest. Indeed, Open Source is
                    used today to surveil and even oppress them."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Free Software, Perens explains, is now 50 years old and the
                    first announcement of Open Source occurred 30 years ago.
                    "Isn't it time for us to take a look at what we've been
                    doing, and see if we can do better? Well, yes, but we need
                    to preserve Open Source at the same time. Open Source will
                    continue to exist and provide the same rules and paradigm,
                    and the thing that comes after Open Source should be called
                    something else and should never try to pass itself off as
                    Open Source. So far, I call it Post-Open."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Post-Open, as he describes it, is a bit more involved than
                    Open Source. It would define the corporate relationship with
                    developers to ensure companies paid a fair amount for the
                    benefits they receive. It would remain free for individuals
                    and non-profit, and would entail just one license.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He imagines a simple yearly compliance process that gets
                    companies all the rights they need to use Post-Open
                    software. And they'd fund developers who would be encouraged
                    to write software that's usable by the common person, as
                    opposed to technical experts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pointing to popular applications from Apple, Google, and
                    Microsoft, Perens says: "A lot of the software is oriented
                    toward the customer being the product – they're certainly
                    surveilled a great deal, and in some cases are actually
                    abused. So it's a good time for open source to actually do
                    stuff for normal people."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The reason that doesn't often happen today, says Perens, is
                    that open source developers tend to write code for
                    themselves and those who are similarly adept with
                    technology. The way to avoid that, he argues, is to pay
                    developers, so they have support to take the time to make
                    user-friendly applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Companies, he suggests, would foot the bill, which could be
                    apportioned to contributing developers using the sort of
                    software that instruments GitHub and shows who contributes
                    what to which products. Merico, he says, is a company that
                    provides such software.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Perens acknowledges that a lot of stumbling blocks need to
                    be overcome, like finding an acceptable entity to handle the
                    measurements and distribution of funds. What's more, the
                    financial arrangements have to appeal to enough developers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "And all of this has to be transparent and adjustable enough
                    that it doesn't fork 100 different ways," he muses. "So, you
                    know, that's one of my big questions. Can this really
                    happen?"

                    influencers, have also been criticized for being overly
                    sexualised, with Aitana regularly appearing in underwear.
                    The agency said sexualisation is "prevalent with real models
                    and influencers" and that its creations "merely mirror these
                    established practices without deviating from the current
                    norms in the industry."

                  <p>
                    Mercer, the human influencer, argued: "It feels like women
                    in recent years have been able to take back some agency,
                    through OnlyFans, through social media, they have been able
                    to take control of their bodies and say 'for so long men
                    have made money off me, I am going to make money for

                  <p>
                    But she said AI-generated creations, often made by men, were
                    once again profiting from female sexuality. "That is the
                    reason behind growing these accounts. It is to make money."

                    [...] It wasn't until four years after the war's end that
                    the first Type I Beetle made its way to North America,
                    thanks to Dutch importer Ben Pon. He brought the first
                    Beetles across the Atlantic in January of 1949 and drove one
                    of them fruitlessly up and down the Eastern Seaboard,
                    looking for a buyer, eventually selling it for $800 to help
                    pay off a hotel bill. By the year's end, however, he had
                    only sold two of the vehicles that reporters dubbed
                    "Hitler's car," which Pon tried to re-label as the "Victory
                    Wagon." 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pon returned to Europe, and importer Max Hoffman stepped in
                    as the first official stateside Volkswagen dealer. Hoffman
                    earned the exclusive right to sell Volkswagens east of the
                    Mississippi, and by 1960 he had placed 300,000 American
                    buyers behind their wheels.

                    [...] Disney took advantage of the Beetle's popularity and
                    unique style, making it the star of the 1969 film "Herbie
                    the Love Bug," along with several movie sequels and a 1982
                    television series.

                    >, writer and producer Bill Walsh conducted a multi-car
                    audition to select the right car to star as Herbie. "As the
                    employees passed by on their way to lunch," Walsh said,
                    "they looked at the little cars, kicked the tires, and
                    turned the steering wheels. But everybody who went by patted
                    the Volkswagen. The VW had a personality of its own that
                    reached out and embraced people."

                    [...] By 1974, Volkswagen had moved production of the Beetle
                    from Wolfsburg to its new plants in Mexico and Brazil, and,
                    beginning in 1977, only sold the Type I Beetle in the U.S.
                    in convertible form. Throughout the 1970s, the Type I
                    gradually grew more powerful and driver-friendly, getting a
                    larger windshield, automatic transmission, and electronic
                    fuel injection.

                    Volkswagen introduced the New Beetle in 1998, with the
                    familiar rounded shape but proper 20th-century features like
                    a sunroof, air bags, and a turbocharger. While the early New
                    Beetles had these modern features, VW tried to maintain the
                    link to the car's hippie roots by including a flower vase as
                    a dealer accessory.

                    clocked the 1999 New Beetle as capable of going from zero to

                    On Apple devices equipped with these protections, such
                    attackers are still unable to perform key post-exploitation
                    techniques such as injecting malicious code into other
                    processes, or modifying kernel code or sensitive kernel
                    data. This powerful protection was bypassed by exploiting a
                    vulnerability in the secret function. The protection, which
                    has rarely been defeated in exploits found to date, is also
                    present in Apple's M1 and M2 CPUs.

                    exploited four zero-days to ensure that the Triangulation
                    malware ran with root privileges and gained complete control
                    over the device and user data stored on it.

                    more sophisticated attacks continue to find ways to defeat

                    chips despite launching a year earlier. The comments
                    contradict recent

                    [...] Additionally, TSMC is confident that its 2nm N2 node,
                    slated for 2025, will outperform N3P and 18A. Following the
                    company's inaugural 3nm process pattern, Apple could get
                    first dibs on N2 and utilize it for the iPhone 17 Pro.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Much of Gelsinger's confidence in 20A and 18A lies in their
                    introduction of the RibbonFET architecture – the company's
                    take on gate-all-around (GAA) transistors and backside power
                    delivery. These technologies will become crucial for
                    companies manufacturing 2nm chips, enabling higher logic
                    densities and clock speeds with reduced power leakage.
                    Meanwhile, TSMC's N3P and other upcoming 3nm nodes will
                    continue utilizing the mature FinFET architecture until it
                    migrates to GAA with N2 a year after Intel.

                    People with type I diabetes have to inject themselves
                    multiple times a day with manufactured insulin to maintain
                    healthy levels of the hormone, as their bodies do not
                    naturally produce enough. The injections also have to be
                    timed in response to eating and exercise, as any consumption
                    or use of glucose has to be managed.

                    Research into glucose-responsive insulin, or "smart"
                    insulin, hopes to improve the quality of life for people
                    with type I diabetes by developing a form of insulin that
                    needs to be injected less frequently, while providing
                    control of blood-glucose levels over a longer period of
                    time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A team at Zhejiang University, China, has recently released
                    a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01138-7#"

                    documenting an improved smart insulin system in animal
                    models—the current work doesn't involve any human testing.
                    Their insulin was able to regulate blood-glucose levels for
                    a week in diabetic mice and minipigs after a single
                    subcutaneous injection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The new smart insulin is based on a form of insulin
                    modified with gluconic acid, which forms a complex with a
                    polymer through chemical bonds and strong electrostatic
                    attraction. When insulin is trapped in the polymer, its
                    signaling function is blocked, allowing a week's worth of
                    insulin to be given via a single injection without a risk of
                    overdose.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Crucial to the "glucose responsive" nature of this system is
                    the fact that the chemical structures of glucose and
                    gluconic acid are extremely similar, meaning the two
                    molecules bind in very similar ways. When glucose meets the
                    insulin-polymer complex, it can displace some of the bound
                    insulin and form its own chemical bonds to the polymer.
                    Glucose binding also disrupts the electrostatic attraction
                    and further promotes insulin release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This system mimics the body's natural process, in
                    which insulin is also released in response to glucose.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The study is not without its limitations. Although
                    long-term glucose regulation was seen in the mice and
                    minipigs examined, only a few animals were involved in the
                    study—five mice and three minipigs. And of course, there's
                    always the risk that the results of animal studies don't
                    completely track over to clinical trials in humans. "We have
                    to accept that these are animal studies, and so going across
                    to humans is always a bit of an issue," said Bain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although more research is required before this smart insulin
                    system can be tested in humans, this work is a promising
                    step forward in the field.

                    Plasma could be wrangled to collide photons and yield
                    matter, according to physicists who ran simulations to

                    The equation at work here is Einstein’s E = mc^2, which
                    establishes a relationship between energy and mass;
                    specifically, the equation holds that energy and mass are
                    equivalent when the latter is multiplied by the speed of
                    light, squared.

                    A team led by scientists at Osaka University and UC San
                    Diego recently simulated the collisions of photons using
                    lasers; their results suggest that the collisions would
                    yield pairs of electrons and positrons. The positrons—the
                    antiparticle of the electron—could then be accelerated by
                    the laser’s electric field to produce a positron beam. Their
                    results are

                    The experimental set-up is possible, the release added, at
                    laser intensities that currently exist. The researchers used
                    simulations to test potential experimental set-ups and found
                    a compelling one. The photon-photon collider uses the
                    Breit-Wheeler process to produce matter, meaning it
                    annihilates gamma-rays to produce electron-positron pairs.

                    [...] “This research shows a potential way to explore the
                    mysteries of the universe in a laboratory setting,” said
                    Vyacheslav Lukin, a program director at the National Science
                    Foundation, which supported the recent research. “The future
                    possibilities at today’s and tomorrow’s high-power laser
                    facilities just became even more intriguing.”

                    The experiment could provide a way to peer into the

                    much closer to home. But for that to happen, an experiment

                <div>
                  <p>
                    In 1986,
                    <a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/papers/ERL-M85-95.pdf"
                      >a 28-page paper</a

                    [PDF] — co-written with Larry Rowe — announced the design
                    for Postgres, as it was then known, setting out six guiding
                    ambitions. Among them were two that would prove pertinent to
                    the database system's longevity. One was to provide better
                    support for complex objects. The second was to provide user
                    extendibility for data types, operators and access methods.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Nonetheless it was Oracle that made a decision which
                    provided a boost to open source PostgreSQL. It bought open
                    source MySQL, which some of the community did not trust in
                    the hands of the proprietary software giant. At the same
                    time Illustra and other companies commercialized Postgres,
                    Berkeley released the code for POSTGRES under the MIT
                    license, allowing other developers to work on it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1994, Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen, both Berkeley graduates,
                    replaced query language POSTQUEL with SQL. The resulting
                    Postgres95 was made freely available and modifiable under a
                    more permissive license and renamed PostgreSQL.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "What ended up happening was Illustra kind of gaining
                    traction, but the big kicker was when this group of totally
                    unrelated people I didn't even know, picked up the open
                    source Postgres code, which was still around, and ran with
                    it, totally unbeknownst to me. That was a wonderful
                    accident," he says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "When MySQL was bought by Oracle, developers got suspicious
                    in droves, and defected to PostgreSQL. It was another happy
                    accident. It's commercial success is wonderful, but it was
                    largely serendipitous," Stonebraker adds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Despite many of his ideas being so widely used in the
                    database industry, which Gartner said was worth $91 billion
                    in 2022, Stonebraker is laid back about other people using
                    his ideas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I've done well financially. I knew Ted Codd, who was very
                    magnanimous about saying you guys should all run the
                    [ideas]. You want to change the world; any particular person
                    is only part of that. I've always done open source code and
                    shared code with anybody who wanted it. In the process, I've
                    done well financially so yeah, I have no regrets at all," he
                    says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But that's not to say he is ready to retire. In his latest
                    project, Stonebraker is ready to change the world again.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The idea for
                    <a href="https://dbos-project.github.io/">DBOS</a>, a
                    Database-Oriented Operating System, came from a conversation
                    with Matei Zaharia, the author of Apache Spark who is also
                    co-founder of analytics and ML company
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/14/databricks_funding/"

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The new project replaced Linux and Kubernetes with a
                    new operating system stack at the bottom of which is a
                    database system, the prototype multi-node multi-core,
                    transactional, highly-available VoltDB, which Stonebraker
                    started.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Basically, the operating system is an application to the
                    database, rather than the other way around," he says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11112">paper</a>
                    Stonebraker co-authored with Zaharia and others explains:
                    "All operating system state should be represented uniformly
                    as database tables, and operations on this state should be
                    made via queries from otherwise stateless tasks. This design
                    makes it easy to scale and evolve the OS without
                    whole-system refactoring, inspect and debug system state,
                    upgrade components without downtime, manage decisions using
                    machine learning, and implement sophisticated security
                    features."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Successful or otherwise, the OS-as-a-database application
                    idea is unlikely to be Stonebraker's last. After turning 80
                    in October, he tells <em>The Register</em> he is not about
                    to slow down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I can't imagine playing golf three days a week. I like what
                    I do, and I will do it as long as I can be intellectually
                    competitive," he says.

                    mechanical timepieces past but the International Trade
                    Commission, which found that the California-based computer

                    Apple's watch problems started back in January. That's when
                    a court found that the light-based pulse oximetry sensor
                    (found on the back of the watches) infringed patents held by
                    Masimo, a medical device manufacturer also based in
                    California.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the time, Apple said since Masimo was not a
                    consumer-focused company, it chose not to collaborate or
                    acquire the medical device maker. Masimo, for its part, said
                    that Apple led it on in discussions then took its idea and
                    hired away Masimo engineers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In October,
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/apple-watch-facing-potential-ban-after-losing-masimo-patent-case/"
                      >the ITC upheld the ruling of infringement</a
                    >
                    and started the process to ban imports of the watches,
                    giving US President Joe Biden's administration 60 days to
                    review the case and possibly veto the ruling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the Biden administration has chosen not to interfere,
                    unlike in 2013 when the Obama administration vetoed a ban on
                    iPhones and iPads during a patent dispute between Apple and
                    Samsung. Although the ITC's import ban on Apple Watch Series
                    9 and Ultra 2 models was supposed to go into effect on
                    December 26,

                    US as soon as possible," Apple said in a statement.

                    to pause the ban until US Customs and Border Protection
                    decides whether redesigned Apple Watches no longer infringe
                    on Masimo's patents, a decision that should be reached by
                    January 12. Now the court has given the ITC a deadline of
                    January 10 to respond to Apple.

                    that The New York Times was considering joining the growing
                    legion of creators that are suing AI companies for
                    misappropriating their content. The Times had reportedly
                    been negotiating with OpenAI regarding the potential to
                    license its material, but those talks had not gone smoothly.
                    So, eight months after the company was reportedly
                    considering suing,
                    <a
                      href="https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf"
                      >the suit has now been filed</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Times is targeting various companies under the OpenAI
                    umbrella, as well as Microsoft, an OpenAI partner that both
                    uses it to power its Copilot service and helped provide the
                    infrastructure for training the GPT Large Language Model.
                    But the suit goes well beyond the use of copyrighted
                    material in training, alleging that OpenAI-powered software
                    will happily circumvent the Times' paywall and ascribe
                    hallucinated misinformation to the Times.
                  </p>
                  <p><i>Journalism is expensive</i></p>
                  <p>
                    The suit notes that The Times maintains a large staff that
                    allows it to do things like dedicate reporters to a huge
                    range of beats and engage in important investigative
                    journalism, among other things. Because of those
                    investments, the newspaper is often considered an
                    authoritative source on many matters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All of that costs money, and The Times earns that by
                    limiting access to its reporting through a robust paywall.
                    In addition, each print edition has a copyright
                    notification, the Times' terms of service limit the copying
                    and use of any published material, and it can be selective
                    about how it licenses its stories. In addition to driving
                    revenue, these restrictions also help it to maintain its
                    reputation as an authoritative voice by controlling how its
                    works appear.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The suit alleges that OpenAI-developed tools undermine all
                    of that. "By providing Times content without The Times's
                    permission or authorization, Defendants' tools undermine and
                    damage The Times's relationship with its readers and deprive
                    The Times of subscription, licensing, advertising, and
                    affiliate revenue," the suit alleges.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Part of the unauthorized use The Times alleges came during
                    the training of various versions of GPT. Prior to GPT-3.5,
                    information about the training dataset was made public. One
                    of the sources used is a large collection of online material
                    called "Common Crawl," which the suit alleges contains
                    information from 16 million unique records from sites
                    published by The Times. That places the Times as the third
                    most references source, behind Wikipedia and a database of
                    US patents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    OpenAI no longer discloses as many details of the data used
                    for training of recent GPT versions, but all indications are
                    that full-text NY Times articles are still part of that
                    process. [...] Expect access to training information to be a
                    major issue during discovery if this case moves forward.

                    the material ingested during training can come back out
                    during use. "Defendants' GenAI tools can generate output
                    that recites Times content verbatim, closely summarizes it,
                    and mimics its expressive style, as demonstrated by scores
                    of examples," the suit alleges.

                    Axon CEO Rick Smith claims his highly successful Taser
                    company was inspired by the death of two school friends
                    gunned down years ago. But much of the tale is false,
                    Reuters found, part of a pattern of misrepresentations and
                    self-serving behavior among top Axon executives.<br />...<br />He
                    started the company, he said, after "two of my high school
                    friends were shot and killed." Projected behind him were
                    photographs of the slain youths, marked with the dates of
                    their short lives.<br />...<br />Smith was not friends with
                    the deceased, Todd Bogers and Cory Holmes, according to
                    three immediate family members and a close friend of the
                    young men. They were gunned down after a road rage incident
                    in 1991, not 1990, as indicated on Smith's slide in Las
                    Vegas. Smith played on the same football team as the boys at
                    Chaparral in Scottsdale, Arizona – but not at the same time,
                    according to school yearbooks seen by Reuters. The boys who
                    were killed graduated in 1986. Smith does not appear in the
                    yearbooks until the school year that ended in 1987.<br />Axon
                    "ran a whole advertising campaign based on the murder of my
                    son," Todd's father John Bogers said in an interview,
                    recalling feelings of bereavement that the ads triggered.
                    "They profited off that, and they didn't ask for
                    permission."<br />...<br />Shelby Bogers and Christopher
                    Holmes, siblings of the football players Todd and Cory, said
                    the story came as news to them: They did not learn about
                    Smith's narrative until more than 15 years after their
                    brothers' deaths, they said.
                    <b
                      >Smith wasn't close with Todd or Cory, didn't attend their
                      joint funeral and never offered a hand during the
                      four-year search for the killer,</b
                    >
                    Shelby Bogers said. Now Axon is "calling them his childhood
                    friends," she said. "That word pisses me off."<br />...<br />Smith's
                    wife ...was employed by the company in the role of "CEO
                    Support" and "Personal Assistant,"

                    [...] It is important to note that, despite the hype, to
                    exploit these vulnerabilities it is necessary to have access
                    to the system in the first place, and in that access, to
                    have privileges to write to the EFI partition and UEFI
                    non-volatile ram (nvram). The keen-eyed reader will realize
                    that, if you already have that level of access, then it's
                    not necessarily the LogoFAIL exploit itself that is the
                    problem, but rather the persistence that it enables for
                    other malware to abuse. Consider, for example, a ransomware
                    that persists even system reimaging attempts after an
                    infrastructure-wide attack. It would cripple recovery
                    operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Adding insult to injury, the vulnerabilities exist across
                    multiple platforms and architectures. It impacts both x86
                    and ARM-based devices. BIOS vendors like AMI, Phoenix, and
                    others, create firmware that is affected by LogoFAIL. In
                    turn, this makes motherboards using that firmware to also be
                    affected by it – it doesn't matter if server-grade or
                    consumer-grade hardware, as the same BIOS vendors will
                    provide software for all of them. Vendors like Intel, Dell,
                    Supermicro, Acer, and many others are therefore affected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] These findings highlight another dimension of software
                    supply chain risks. Directly targeting hardware adds to the
                    already complex array of threats affecting software supply
                    chains, from developer tools to source code repositories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fact that a given workload is potentially affected by
                    vulnerabilities all throughout this large dependency and
                    environment chain is something that we seem to turn a blind
                    eye to – either through a lack of awareness or an inability
                    to effectively prevent it – but which doesn't make it any
                    more secure.

                    Hundreds of Windows and Linux computer models from virtually
                    all hardware makers are vulnerable to a new attack that
                    executes malicious firmware early in the boot-up sequence, a
                    feat that allows infections that are nearly impossible to
                    detect or remove using current defense mechanisms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The attack—dubbed LogoFAIL by the researchers who devised
                    it—is notable for the relative ease in carrying it out, the
                    breadth of both consumer- and enterprise-grade models that
                    are susceptible, and the high level of control it gains over
                    them. In many cases, LogoFAIL can be remotely executed in
                    post-exploit situations using techniques that can't be
                    spotted by traditional endpoint security products. And
                    because exploits run during the earliest stages of the boot
                    process, they are able to bypass a host of defenses,
                    including the industry-wide Secure Boot, Intel's Secure
                    Boot, and similar protections from other companies that are
                    devised to prevent so-called bootkit infections.
                  </p>
                  <p>Game over for platform security</p>
                  <p>
                    LogoFAIL is a constellation of two dozen newly discovered
                    vulnerabilities that have lurked for years, if not decades,
                    in Unified Extensible Firmware Interfaces responsible for
                    booting modern devices that run Windows or Linux. The
                    vulnerabilities are the product of almost a year's worth of
                    work by Binarly, a firm that helps customers identify and
                    secure vulnerable firmware.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As its name suggests, LogoFAIL involves logos,
                    specifically those of the hardware seller that are displayed
                    on the device screen early in the boot process, while the
                    UEFI is still running. Image parsers in UEFIs from all three
                    major IBVs are riddled with roughly a dozen critical
                    vulnerabilities that have gone unnoticed until now. By
                    replacing the legitimate logo images with identical-looking
                    ones that have been specially crafted to exploit these bugs,
                    LogoFAIL makes it possible to execute malicious code at the
                    most sensitive stage of the boot process, which is known as
                    DXE, short for Driver Execution Environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Once arbitrary code execution is achieved during the DXE
                    phase, it's game over for platform security," researchers
                    from Binarly, the security firm that discovered the
                    vulnerabilities, wrote in a whitepaper. "From this stage, we
                    have full control over the memory and the disk of the target
                    device, thus including the operating system that will be
                    started."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    From there, LogoFAIL can deliver a second-stage payload that
                    drops an executable onto the hard drive before the main OS
                    has even started.

                    IT security teams are assessing new UEFI vulnerabilities
                    that affect Windows and Linux systems. The vulnerabilities
                    are collectively called LogoFAIL because they exist in UEFI
                    image parsers that display the manufacturer logo when the
                    system boots up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Affected vendors include UEFI suppliers AMI, Insyde, and
                    Phoenix and device manufacturers such as Lenovo, Dell, and
                    HP. Some vendors have already issued advisories, but we
                    should expect the list to expand as more vendors assess
                    their exposure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Defenders need to know which systems are affected by
                    LogoFAIL vulnerabilities and the associated severity. The
                    CERT Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon has
                    <a href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/811862"
                      >a dynamic list of affected vendors</a
                    >
                    and associated security advisories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So far, it is difficult to determine the severity as no
                    public exploit has been published, and some of the now
                    public vulnerabilities have been scored differently by the
                    researchers from Binarly who discovered the LogoFAIL
                    vulnerabilities, the UEFI firmware vendors (Phoenix
                    Technologies, Insyde, and AMI), and the National
                    Vulnerability Database (NVD). The severity and
                    exploitability of each LogoFAIL vulnerability will likely
                    depend on how affected firmware vendors and equipment
                    manufacturers (OEMs) store and process logo images. An
                    attacker's ability to modify these logo images or paths to
                    them may depend on malicious software running locally on a
                    system (with administrative or root-level privileges), by an
                    attacker remotely accessing the system, or by an attacker
                    who gained physical access to a target.

                    You should monitor and apply patches as they become
                    available from each OEM for each product model. As of the
                    time of this writing, the list of affected products that
                    have associated CVE identifiers includes the following:

                    >
                    and has been scored a CVSS 5.5 (Medium) by the NVD. The
                    aforementioned CVE correlates to Binarly's vulnerability
                    identifier BRLY-LOGOFAIL-2023-006 with an assigned CVSS of
                    8.2 (High). The difference in CVSS score appears to result
                    from differences in perceived potential impact on
                    confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

                    are flowing uphill, we calculated what the stresses are that
                    cause them to move in that direction. If you have a negative
                    angle of repose, then you must have cohesion to give a
                    negative coefficient of friction. These granular flow
                    equations were never derived to consider these things, but
                    after calculating it, what came out is an apparent
                    coefficient of friction that is negative.”

                    It's an intriguing proof of principle that could one day
                    lead to new ways to control how substances mix or separate,
                    as well as potential swarming microrobotics applications.
                    The scientists have already started building tiny staircases
                    with laser cutters and videotaping the micro-rollers
                    climbing up and down the other. One micro-roller can't
                    overcome the height of each step, but many working
                    collectively can do so, per Gilchrist.

                    Python's been around in one form or another for over 30
                    years. Over that time, it has accumulated a wide and
                    powerful set of modules in its standard library. These
                    modules help developers get started with many common tasks.

                    But over the years, some of those batteries have
                    died—meaning they've gone out of maintenance, or been used
                    for technologies that are now obsolete. Some of these "dead
                    batteries" were

                    Reindeer appear to snooze throughout the day while chewing
                    their cud. This may be an adaptation to their Arctic
                    habitat, where food is abundant in the summer and they must
                    constantly eat to gain enough weight to survive the winter.

                    ruminate – that is, they regurgitate food from their stomach
                    back into their mouth for extra chewing. And they often take
                    on a trance-like stare as they chomp. “You can sort of see
                    it in their face, they’re a bit gone,” says
                    <a href="https://www.nibio.no/en/employees/gabriela-wagner"
                      >Gabriela Wagner</a

                    at the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research. “But
                    nobody knew if they were actually asleep because no one has
                    ever measured the brainwaves of reindeer before.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Wagner and her colleagues used an electroencephalograph
                    (EEG) – metal electrodes attached to the heads of four
                    captive Eurasian tundra reindeer (Rangifer tarandus
                    tarandus), which recorded electrical pulses in their brains
                    over the next few days as they ate, slept and moved around.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The reindeer's brainwave patterns revealed that, when
                    ruminating, they were in a light stage of sleep known as
                    non-REM sleep, suggesting the animals can recharge while
                    chewing their cud. "It looks very much like human sleep –
                    it's got the same stages of sleep spindles and slow wave
                    activity," says Wagner, describing bursts of brain activity
                    visible on the EEG. They also found that the more time the
                    reindeer spent ruminating, the less they needed additional
                    rest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Resting while ruminating may also explain why, unlike
                    most other species that sleep more in winter, reindeer
                    appear to sleep the same amount regardless of the season.

                    on and boring the judge,” said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, an
                    antitrust law expert and professor at Vanderbilt Law School.

                    “Especially when it’s a bench trial, you don’t want to be in
                    a situation where you’re putting irrelevant proof. You have
                    to pick and choose your strongest witnesses,” Allensworth
                    added.

                    There are only a handful of trusted end-to-end encrypted
                    email providers. Of those, Tuta (which has long been known
                    as "Tutanota" but recently rebranded ) is one of the more
                    well-known. This week, the company found itself on the
                    defensive after being labeled a "front" for law enforcement
                    and intelligence services. In an attempt to clear its name,
                    the company released a statement denying that it's a
                    honeypot operation, after a former, highly placed Canadian
                    intelligence official alleged in court that was the case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The cop in question, Cameron Ortis, formerly ran a "highly
                    secret unit" within the Royal Canadian Mountain Police, but
                    is now on trial for allegedly having attempted to sell
                    government intelligence to criminals, CBC reports.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ortis has denied that he was actually attempting to sell
                    state secrets. In his testimony, which was made public this
                    week, Ortis instead said that he was involved in a special
                    operation. As part of that operation, agents used Tuta,
                    which he described as a "storefront"—or a kind of
                    honeypot—to lure in prospective criminals for surveillance,
                    he said. CBC describes the former government official's
                    allegations like this:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        ...according to Ortis, [another agent] briefed him about
                        a "storefront" that was being created to attract
                        criminal targets to an online encryption service. A
                        storefront, said Ortis, is a fake business or entity,
                        either online or bricks-and-mortar, set up by police or
                        intelligence agencies. The plan, he said, was to have
                        criminals use the storefront — an online end-to-end
                        encryption service called Tutanota — to allow
                        authorities to collect intelligence about them.

                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    "So if targets begin to use that service, the agency that's
                    collecting that information would be able to feed it back,
                    that information, into the Five Eyes system, and then back
                    into the RCMP," Ortis claimed, in reference to the Five Eyes
                    intelligence-sharing alliance, of which Canada is a
                    prominent member. Ortis has claimed that some unnamed Five
                    Eyes foreign agent introduced him to the honeypot operation
                    and that he didn't notify his superiors at the RCMP about
                    it. Follow-up questions about the whole thing have mostly
                    led him to say things like "I don't recall," and "that's
                    something I can't talk about."

                Some of you will have enjoyed a good meal over Christmas,
                perhaps also at Thanksgiving if you are an American. It possibly
                included potatoes in some form; mashed, boiled, roasted, baked
                or in some other form of cooking. You would have probably
                considered them a vegetable. But the US Dietary Guidelines
                Advisory Committee is planning to change that.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>

                    What an insult to potatoes everywhere. The US Dietary
                    Guidelines Advisory Committee is expected in 2025 to declare
                    that potatoes aren't actually vegetables and instead will
                    lump them in with grains and rice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic
                    Research Service, the primary vegetables consumed by
                    Americans are potatoes and tomatoes. In 2019, the average
                    American consumed nearly 50 pounds of potatoes and
                    approximately 31 pounds of tomatoes throughout the year.
                    French fries and pizza sauce FTW!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The suggestion to reclassify potatoes as a non-vegetable is
                    not grounded in any scientific metric," Kam Quarles, CEO of
                    the National Potato Council, testified at a Dietary
                    Guidelines Advisory Committee meeting. "This unsupported
                    notion, if acted upon, will confuse consumers, could result
                    in nutrient gaps and also decreased vegetable consumption.
                    We ask the Committee to avoid this chaotic outcome and
                    continue to acknowledge the fact that potatoes are a
                    vegetable."

              <p>
                Do you agree with this reclassification? Should the same 'logic'
                be applied to other root vegetables which today are commonly
                thought to be correctly described already? Parsnips, beet, sweet
                potato, onion, etc. Or is this a case of a government body
                thinking that it must make changes to justify its existence?

                  <p>Chips are not getting cheaper.</p>
                  <p>
                    Increasingly sophisticated wafer fab tools are needed to
                    produce chips on leading-edge process technologies, thus
                    intensifying costs with each new node. Analysts from
                    International Business Strategies believe that the situation
                    will worsen at 2nm, with chip costs growing by around 50%
                    compared to 3nm processors, reports <a
                      href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/The-great-nanometer-chip-race"
                      >Nikkei</a
                    >, ultimately resulting in a $30,000 price tag for each
                    wafer of 2nm chips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    IBS estimates that a 2nm-capable fab with a capacity of
                    roughly 50,000 wafer starts per month (WSPM) costs around
                    $28 billion, up from around $20 billion for a 3nm fab with a
                    similar production capacity. The cost increase will be
                    driven by the increased number of EUV litho tools required
                    to maintain a 50,000 WSPM capacity for a 2nm-class
                    technology. This will significantly increase production
                    costs per wafer and per chip, which will inevitably affect
                    companies that use leading-edge fabrication technologies,
                    such as Apple, which is currently the only company that mass
                    produces processors for smartphones and PCs using TSMC's
                    latest N3B (3nm-class fabrication process).

                    [...] However, IBS seems to be a little dramatic with its
                    per-chip cost estimate. The company believes that Apple's
                    current 3nm per-chip cost is around $50, but it does not
                    define the chip's die size. <a

                    one 300-mm wafer can fit 586 of these, which brings their
                    cost to approximately $34 at an unrealistic 100% yield and
                    $40 at a more realistic 85% yield.

                    [...] Even with very rough estimates about 2nm fab costs and
                    wafer costs, it is clear that chips made using a 2nm node
                    will be more expensive than processors produced on a
                    3nm-class process technology. That said, expect companies
                    like AMD and Intel to accelerate the adoption of
                    multi-chipset designs comprised of chiplets made on
                    different nodes in the coming years, thus defraying the
                    costs associated with leading-edge nodes. Meanwhile, it is
                    likely that smartphone processors will retain monolithic
                    designs for a while as advanced packaging costs are still
                    quite high.

                    single source for enabling RISC-V devices and promote
                    standards for the RISC-V industry, which has been criticized

                    RISC-V is an open-standard (or open-source, depending on who
                    you ask) instruction set architecture (ISA) for CPUs that
                    was first established in 2014, and is maintained by RISC-V
                    International. The basic premise for RISC-V is that any
                    company can take the ISA and make their own CPUs, bypassing
                    the closed ecosystems of Arm, AMD, and Intel. Since its
                    debut, RISC-V has grown extremely quickly, with

                    Qualcomm is invested in the production of Arm
                    architecture-based chips, so it might seem unintuitive for
                    the company to get into RISC-V too. However, Qualcomm has
                    actually been using RISC-V for five years for its
                    microcontrollers, as have many other companies. Qualcomm is
                    also using RISC-V for its

                    is what RISC means), RISC-V is inherently minimalistic, and
                    it's found a niche in small chips.

                    Quintauris says its products will initially focus on the
                    automotive industry and then later cater to mobile and
                    Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The company is also
                    focused on promoting standards for the RISC-V
                    hardware-software ecosystem, and the implication appears to
                    be that the launch of successful products developed by
                    several big companies will help realize standardization.

                    The publication says this duel has “raised questions in
                    Washington about whether Apple has used its market dominance
                    over iMessage to block competition and force consumers to
                    spend more on iPhones than lower-priced alternatives.”

                    People familiar with the matter told the Justice
                    Department’s antitrust lawyer met with Eric Migicovsky, the
                    co-founder of Beeper, about this possible anticompetitive
                    behavior by Apple. At the same time, the FTC posted in its
                    blog that it would scrutinize “dominant” players that “use
                    privacy and security as a justification to disallow
                    interoperability” between services.

                    Although ultimately, this fight has more to do with
                    Americans being used to texting through the Messages app
                    instead of WhatsApp, Telegram, or another alternative, the
                    government is worried about anticompetitive behavior from
                    Apple, as it has been questioning the company about the App
                    Store, Apple Pay monopoly, and so on.

                    Multiple key barriers prevent Windows 10-compatible PCs from
                    running Windows 10, including a need for a 64-bit processor
                    listed by Microsoft as a 'supported CPU,' at least 4 GB of
                    RAM, a minimum of 64GB storage, and UEFI firmware with
                    Secure Boot capability instead of the older BIOS.
                    Additionally, a crucial requirement is TPM version 2.0 for

                    many older iGPUs. Many systems are still running outdated
                    CPUs and using BIOS instead of UEFI with no SecureBoot

                    Canalys believes that a staggering 240 million PCs do not
                    comply with Windows 11's requirements and are set to be
                    rendered obsolete by Windows 10's October 14, 2025 support
                    deadline. While recycling remains a viable option for
                    these systems, the lack of compatibility with the latest
                    Windows iteration significantly devalues them, making
                    refurbishment less feasible. Consequently, despite growing
                    capabilities in the refurbishment sector, many of these
                    devices are still destined for landfills. This situation
                    highlights a critical challenge in managing and disposing of
                    electronic waste, Canalys believes.

                    Interesting as Reddit and Twitter are, they are much less
                    widely used than YouTube, which is used by virtually all
                    [I]nternet users.

                    >
                    – the closest service in terms of usage is Tiktok with 63%
                    and Snapchat with 60%. While YouTube has a good,
                    well-documented API, there’s no good way to get a random,
                    representative sample of YouTube. Instead, most research on
                    YouTube either studies a collection of videos (all videos on
                    the channels of a selected set of users) or videos
                    discovered via recommendation (start with
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
                      >Never Going to Give You Up</a
                    >, objectively the center of the internet, and collect
                    recommended videos.) You can do excellent research with
                    either method, but you won’t get a sample of all YouTube
                    videos and you won’t be able to calculate the size of
                    YouTube.

                    I brought this problem to Jason Baumgartner, creator of
                    PushShift, and prince of the dark arts of data collection.
                    One of Jason’s skills is a deep knowledge of undocumented
                    APIs, ways of collecting data outside of official means.
                    Most platforms have one or more undocumented APIs, widely
                    used by programmers for that platform to build internal
                    tools. In the case of YouTube, that API is called
                    <a
                      href="https://gizmodo.com/how-project-innertube-helped-pull-youtube-out-of-the-gu-1704946491"
                      >“Inner Tube”</a
                    >
                    and its existence is an open secret in programmer
                    communities. Using InnerTube, Jason suggested we do
                    something that’s both really smart and really stupid: guess
                    at random URLs and see if there are videos there.
                  </p>
                </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                As seen in his charts, the amount of videos there grows
                exponentially. Thus one could also conclude that the storage
                costs also grow in proportion.

                    Days before a 10+ day holiday break and associated
                    production change freeze, SEC Consult has published an email
                    spoofing attack that involves a composition of email
                    services with specific differences in the way they handle
                    line endings other than &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unfortunately, criticial information provided by the
                    researcher was not passed on to Postfix maintainers before
                    publication of the attack, otherwise we would certainly have
                    convinced SEC Consult to change their time schedule until
                    after people had a chance to update their Postfix systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The attack involves a COMPOSITION of two email services with
                    specific differences in the way they handle line endings
                    other than &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      - One email service A that does not recognize broken line
                    endings in SMTP such as in &lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;
                    in an email message from an authenticated attacker to a
                    recipient at email service B, and that propagates those
                    broken line endings verbatim when it forwards that message
                    to:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      - One different email service B that does support broken
                    line endings in SMTP such as in
                    &lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;. When this is followed by
                    "smuggled" SMTP MAIL/RCPT/DATA commands and message header
                    plus body text, email service B is tricked into receiving
                    two email messages: one message with the content before the
                    &lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;, and one message with the
                    "smuggled" header plus body text after the "smuggled" SMTP
                    commands. All this when email service A sends only one
                    message.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Postfix is an example of email service B. Microsoft's
                    outlook.com was an example of email service A.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The "smuggled" SMTP MAIL/RCPT/DATA commands and header plus
                    body text can be used to spoof email from any sender whose
                    domain is hosted at email service A, to any recipient whose
                    domain is hosted at email service B. Such email will pass
                    SPF-based DMARC checks at email service B, because the
                    smuggled message has a sender address that is hosted at
                    email service A, and because the message was received from
                    email service A.
