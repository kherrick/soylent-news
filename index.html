                    Boeing faces a new investigation after the planemaker told
                    US regulators it might have failed to properly carry out
                    some quality inspections on its 787 Dreamliner planes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was
                    "investigating whether Boeing completed the inspections and
                    whether company employees may have falsified aircraft
                    records".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] The Boeing executive overseeing the 787 programme,
                    Scott Stocker, wrote in an internal memo, seen by the
                    Guardian, that the problem was reported by an employee and
                    was an instance of "misconduct," but not "an immediate
                    safety of flight issue".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The memo said the company concluded that "several people had
                    been violating company policies by not performing a required
                    test, but recording the work as having been completed".

                A FedEx cargo aircraft made a heart-stopping emergency landing
                at Istanbul Airport Wednesday after its front landing gear
                malfunctioned.

              <p>
                The Boeing 767 cargo plane was on its way from Paris's Charles
                de Gaulle Airport to Istanbul when pilots realized the front
                landing gear failed, according to state-run Anadolu Agency.
              </p>
              <p>
                A screenshot from Turkish TV shows the cargo plane landing at
                Istanbul Airport on Wednesday. No casualties were reported.

                        digits, or fingers.</i

                  <p>
                    [....] To answer the question of why mammals have five
                    fingers, we must first understand why tetrapod (Greek for
                    "four-footed") vertebrates have five fingers. Mammals belong
                    to the superclass Tetrapoda, which also includes reptiles,
                    amphibians and birds. Even members of this group without
                    traditional limbs have five fingers in their skeleton —
                    whales, seals and sea lions have five fingers in their
                    flippers — even if they have four or fewer toes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is some variation: Horses have just one toe, and birds
                    have one fused finger bone at the end of their wing.
                    However, scientists have
                    <a
                      href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2015.0482"
                      >discovered</a
                    >
                    that these animals start out with as many as five fingers as
                    embryos, but they shrink away before they are born.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] Nobody is sure when this five-finger plan first
                    evolved. The first known animals to develop fingers evolved
                    from fish around 360 million years ago and had as many as
                    eight fingers, Stewart said. However, the existence of the
                    five-finger plan in most living tetrapods indicates that the
                    trait is likely a "homology" — a gene or structure that is
                    shared between organisms because they have a common
                    ancestor. The common ancestor of all living tetrapods must
                    have somehow evolved to have five fingers and passed that
                    pattern down to its descendants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A common ancestor explains how mammals got five fingers, but
                    it doesn't tell us why. One theory is canalization — the
                    idea that over time, a gene or trait becomes more stable and
                    less likely to mutate. [....] If the number has worked for
                    millions of years, there's no reason to change it, according
                    to this theory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] Some speculate it might be down to gene linkage: As
                    genes evolve over millions of years, some become linked,
                    meaning changing one gene (the amount of fingers) could lead
                    to other more serious health issues. But as of yet, nobody
                    has offered concrete proof, Stewart told Live Science.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We can ask a very simple question of why don't we see more
                    than five fingers, and it seems like we should arrive at a
                    simple answer," he said. "But it's a really deep problem.
                    That makes [this field] really exciting."

                    If you've ever tried to "future-proof" a purchase by paying
                    for everything you might eventually need up front, you know
                    it can be a sucker's game. The problem? We can't actually
                    see the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But today we got our hands on LPCAMM2 for the first time,
                    and this looks like the future to us. LPCAMM2 is a totally
                    modular, repairable, upgradeable memory standard for
                    laptops, using the latest LPDDR chips for maximum speed and
                    efficiency. So instead of overpaying (or under-speccing)
                    based on guesswork about your future memory needs, you'll
                    hopefully be able to buy your next laptop and then install
                    more RAM as needed. Imagine that!

                    hole, is the point of no return past which no distant
                    observer can ever recover information.

                    [....] What is interesting is that if you have the choice of
                    what black hole to tumble into, bigger is better.

                    "If you have the choice, you want to fall into a
                    supermassive black hole," Schnittman said. "Stellar-mass
                    black holes, which contain up to about 30 solar masses,
                    possess much smaller event horizons and stronger tidal
                    forces, which can rip apart approaching objects before they
                    get to the horizon."

                  <p>
                    [....] The more mass a black hole has, the further from its
                    singularity its event horizon is located. That means with a
                    supermassive black hole, an infalling astronaut would have
                    the chance to pass the event horizon before meeting their
                    grisly fate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] After a real-time duration of around 3 hours and
                    30-minute during two orbits of the black hole, we reach its
                    event horizon. This marks the last point at which any
                    distant observer watching our descent would be able to see
                    us. They would forever see our image at the very edge of the
                    event horizon, frozen.

                    Part of what keeps the game fresh is a continuous trickle of
                    new Pokémon. The game began with just the original 151
                    monsters back in 2016 and has gradually caught up to the
                    current generation of Switch games in bits and pieces over
                    the last eight years. The game is currently in the process
                    of adding monsters from Scarlet and Violet, and that's where
                    this story begins.<br />[...]<br />According to

                    biome in Pokémon Go (though the game Go initially used
                    Google Maps data, it apparently switched to OpenStreetMap

                    users and breaking down Pokémon Go game mechanics for
                    frustrated OSM contributors.<br />[...]<br />Though many
                    users are "truth-stretching" vandals who create nonexistent
                    parks, beaches, and footways to encourage specific Pokémon
                    to spawn, others become "very careful, trustworthy" OSM
                    users who "make many worthy additions to the map" by
                    accurately mapping out places where OSM's data is patchy or
                    outdated.

                    Since the announcement of the suspension of the grant,
                    borderland leaders have expressed their concerns.

                    "Dr. Choudhuri and Dr. Wicker have played pivotal roles in
                    advancing UTEP's Aerospace Center. Their vision has
                    propelled Far West Texas into an era of ambitious growth,
                    positioning us as a competitive force in the aerospace,
                    defense, and advanced manufacturing industry. We will
                    continue our collaboration with UTEP and local partners to
                    ensure the Aerospace Center continues to build economic
                    opportunities and a brighter future for the students,
                    workers, and communities of Far West Texas," says Texas
                    Senator César Blanco.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Over a decade ago, our community united to focus our
                    economic development efforts on aerospace and defense
                    manufacturing, aiming to raise wages, retain talent, and
                    foster job creation, ultimately positioning El Paso as a
                    national leader in these industries," said Congresswoman
                    Veronica Escobar. "At the heart of this vision stands Dr.
                    Ashan Choudhuri, whose leadership has transformed what was
                    once a dream into a tangible reality, unfolding daily before
                    us."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In the statement released by UTEP they did not mention
                    Dr. Ahsan Choudhuri but the university did say that
                    effective immediately, Dr. Kenneth Meissner, Dean of the
                    College of Engineering, will serve as acting head for the
                    center.

                    [...] Major media outlets have reportedly partnered with an
                    AI company called AdVon Commerce to publish tens of
                    thousands of fake product reviews and fill up Google Search
                    results with piles of AI-generated trash.

                  <p>
                    While sites like InformationLiberation are manually
                    blacklisted by Google's "trusted flaggers" for telling the
                    truth, major media outlets which are manually whitelisted by
                    Google for pushing regime propaganda are given top results
                    for any garbage they publish.

                  <p>
                    Regime media have been taking advantage of this setup for
                    years with low-quality clickbait but now they're taking
                    spamming/SEO manipulation to a whole new level with AI.

                I've suspected for quite some time those diversional "news
                article" clickbait sites ( like "She thought it was a dog. When
                the vet saw it, he called the Police! " ) are written by AI,
                designed to make you fish through myriads of buttons to get the
                next snippet of story.

                    could potentially generate up to 22,481 pounds of force

                Someone purchased the eight year old Cheyenne supercomputer for
                $480k. Failing hardware. Leaking water system. What would it be
                good for? Selling for parts would flood the market. Testing the
                parts would take forever. They also have to pay for transport
                from it's current location. Originally built by SGI.

                    Regeneron's gene therapy is being tested in a clinical

                    An experimental gene therapy gave a deaf child the ability
                    to hear, her family and investigators for a clinical trial
                    say.

                  <p>
                    Opal Sandy, the girl, received an injection of DB-OTO,
                    Regeneron's gene therapy, in her ear when she was 11 months
                    old. Her hearing was assessed as normal within six months.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "When Opal could first hear us clapping unaided it was
                    mind-blowing," Jo Sandy, the girl's mother, said in a
                    statement released by the UK's National Health Service
                    (NHS).

                    [...] "Providing the full complexity and spectrum of sound
                    in children born with profound genetic deafness is a
                    phenomenon I did not expect to see in my lifetime," Dr.
                    Lawrence Lustig, chair of Columbia University's Department
                    of Otolaryngology and one of the trial investigators, said
                    in a statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Opal was born with genetic deafness from mutations of the
                    otoferlin gene. About one in every 500 children are born in
                    the United States with little or no ability to hear, and
                    genetic changes like variants of the otoferlin gene are one
                    cause.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Variants in the gene inhibit the production of a protein
                    necessary for communication between the inner ear and the
                    auditory nerve. The problem can be partially rectified with
                    hearing aids or cochlear implants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It was our ultimate goal for Opal to hear all the speech
                    sounds. It's already making a difference to our day-to-day
                    lives, like at bath-time or swimming, when Opal can't wear
                    her cochlear implant," James Sandy, Opal's father, said.

                  <p>
                    The DB-OTO is aimed at restoring the full spectrum of sound
                    to people with mutated otoferlin gene. It's given as an
                    intracochlear injection into one ear, or administered
                    directly to the inner ear. A phase 1/2 clinical trial
                    testing the gene therapy started in 2023, enrolling children
                    in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Spain.

                    as one of the largest scams of its kind, with 76,000 fake

                    A trove of data examined by reporters and IT experts
                    indicates the operation is highly organised, technically

                    Operating on an industrial scale, programmers have created
                    tens of thousands of fake web shops offering discounted
                    goods from Dior, Nike, Lacoste, Hugo Boss, Versace and
                    Prada, as well as many other premium brands.

                    [...] The first fake shops in the network appear to have
                    been created in 2015. More than 1m "orders" have been
                    processed in the past three years alone, according to
                    analysis of the data. Not all payments were successfully
                    processed, but analysis suggests the group may have
                    attempted to take as much as €50m (£43m) over the period.
                    Many shops have been abandoned, but a third of them – more
                    than 22,500 – are still live.

                    of the order until yesterday. The final text has some
                    changes compared to the draft version released a few weeks

                    [...] Advocates warned that mobile carriers could use the 5G
                    technology called "network slicing" to create fast lanes for
                    categories of apps, like online gaming, and charge consumers
                    more for plans that speed up those apps. This isn't just
                    theoretical: Ericsson, a telecommunications vendor that
                    sells equipment to the major carriers, has said the carriers
                    could get more money from gamers by charging "up to $10.99
                    more for a guaranteed gaming experience on top of their 5G
                    monthly subscription."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The final FCC order released yesterday addresses that
                    complaint.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We clarify that a BIAS [Broadband Internet Access Service]
                    provider's decision to speed up 'on the basis of Internet
                    content, applications, or services' would 'impair or
                    degrade' other content, applications, or services which are
                    not given the same treatment," the FCC's final order said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The "impair or degrade" clarification means that speeding up
                    is banned because the no-throttling rule says that ISPs
                    "shall not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic on the
                    basis of Internet content, application, or service."
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    >, AT&amp;T promoted network slicing as a way "to better
                    meet the needs of particular business applications and
                    consumer preferences than they could over a best-efforts
                    network that generally treats all traffic the same."
                    AT&amp;T last week started charging mobile customers an
                    <a

                    for faster wireless data speeds, but this would likely
                    comply with net neutrality rules because the extra speed
                    applies to all broadband traffic rather than just certain
                    types of online applications.

                interaction of the CME with Earth's magnetosphere, and is

                A large cluster of sunspots ejected several CMEs which have

                on Saturday, with the highest planetary K-index expected to be
                8.33. Another CME is expected to start impacting Earth around 15
                UTC on Saturday, with the geomagnetic storm peaking at G2

                    [...] Tory Bruno, president and chief executive of ULA, said
                    the concern was that the vibration could have caused the
                    valve to approach its rated life of 200,000 cycles. The
                    valve was vibrating at 40 hertz, he noted.

                    He said then that engineers would examine if those
                    vibrations involved full cycles of the valve. If so, then
                    ULA would have to replace the valve. [...]

                    The Swiss Army Knife has become such a shorthand for
                    multifunctionality that companies producing
                    does-a-lot-of-stuff wares will often say that their goods
                    are the "Swiss Army Knife" of whatever category they're a
                    part of. You can use the tool to cut stuff, snip stuff,
                    uncork stuff, file stuff, in some cases download stuff.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Victorinox, the company behind the famous gadget, is
                    working on a Swiss Army Knife without the knife part.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We are in the early stages of developing pocket tools
                    without blades," a spokesperson for the company told CNN.
                    Though it won't be discontinuing its bladed version, the
                    company has been trying to figure out how to serve customers
                    in places — specifically England and some Asian countries —
                    where knives aren't as welcome a pocket sight than in other
                    markets. The British government, for example, is considering
                    new legislation on carrying blades in public.

                  <p>
                    The Swiss Army Knife has its roots in 1880s Germany. Then
                    the Swiss Karl Elsener took production over the border. Soon
                    a competitor emerged in the company Wenger, and for a while
                    the Swiss government split its orders for the tools between
                    the two of them. Wenger called its version the "genuine"
                    Swiss Army Knife, and Elsener's Victorinox called its
                    version the "original." The two companies ended up merging
                    in 2005.

                    Nintendo said Tuesday it will make an announcement about a
                    highly anticipated new console by the end of March 2025 as
                    sales decline of the hugely popular Switch, which is now in
                    its eighth year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite logging a record net profit in the year to March,
                    helped by the weak yen, the game giant expects net profit to
                    drop nearly 40% in the current financial year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Players and investors have been hungry for news about a
                    successor to the Switch, and the company said a statement
                    was finally forthcoming.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Nathan Naidu said
                    before the earnings release that Nintendo consoles typically
                    have a "six-to-seven year lifecycle."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Given hardware drives about 40% of total sales, its drag on
                    (the) overall top line might extend into fiscal 2025 absent
                    a new gaming gadget," he said.

                    stopped coming in.

                    The first problem to overcome is that the high heat used to
                    produce plastic would kill off most bacterial spores. So the
                    researchers genetically engineered the microbes to withstand
                    that heat, and found that 96 to 100% of the edited bacteria
                    survived at the plastic processing temperature of 135 °C
                    (275 °F), compared to just 20% of unedited bugs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next, they tested how well the bacteria would break down the
                    plastic, a process that's triggered by nutrients and
                    moisture in the soil. At concentrations of up to 1% of the
                    plastic's weight, the bacteria broke down over 90% of the
                    material within five months of being buried in compost.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's easy to assume that giving plastic its own Achille's
                    heel will only make it weaker during use, but it turns out
                    the opposite is true. Plastic made with the spores was found
                    to be up to 37% tougher and had up to 30% higher tensile
                    strength than regular TPU, with the team hypothesizing that
                    the spores act as a reinforcing filler.

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Researchers have devised an attack against nearly all
                    virtual private network applications that forces them to
                    send and receive some or all traffic outside of the
                    encrypted tunnel designed to protect it from snooping or
                    tampering.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    TunnelVision, as the researchers have named their attack,
                    largely negates the entire purpose and selling point of
                    VPNs, which is to encapsulate incoming and outgoing Internet
                    traffic in an encrypted tunnel and to cloak the user's IP
                    address. The researchers believe it affects all VPN
                    applications when they're connected to a hostile network and
                    that there are no ways to prevent such attacks except when
                    the user's VPN runs on Linux or Android. They also said
                    their attack technique may have been possible since 2002 and
                    may already have been discovered and used in the wild since
                    then.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The effect of TunnelVision is "the victim's traffic is now
                    decloaked and being routed through the attacker directly," a
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajsLmZia6UU"
                      >video demonstration</a
                    >
                    explained. "The attacker can read, drop or modify the leaked
                    traffic and the victim maintains their connection to both
                    the VPN and the Internet."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The attack works by manipulating the
                    <a
                      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol"
                      >DHCP server</a
                    >
                    that allocates IP addresses to devices trying to connect to
                    the local network. A setting known as
                    <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3442"
                      >option 121</a
                    >
                    allows the DHCP server to override default routing rules
                    that send VPN traffic through a local IP address that
                    initiates the encrypted tunnel. By using option 121 to route
                    VPN traffic through the DHCP server, the attack diverts the
                    data to the DHCP server itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Interestingly, Android is the only operating system
                    that fully immunizes VPN apps from the attack because it
                    doesn't implement option 121. For all other OSes, there are
                    no complete fixes.

                    A research team using the ChemCam instrument onboard NASA's
                    Curiosity rover discovered higher-than-usual amounts of
                    manganese in lakebed rocks within Gale Crater on Mars, which
                    indicates that the sediments were formed in a river, delta,
                    or near the shoreline of an ancient lake. The results were
                    published today in

                    "It is difficult for manganese oxide to form on the surface
                    of Mars, so we didn't expect to find it in such high
                    concentrations in a shoreline deposit," said Patrick Gasda,
                    of Los Alamos National Laboratory's Space Science and
                    Applications group and lead author on the study. "On Earth,
                    these types of deposits happen all the time because of the
                    high oxygen in our atmosphere produced by photosynthetic
                    life, and from microbes that help catalyze those manganese
                    oxidation reactions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "On Mars, we don't have evidence for life, and the mechanism
                    to produce oxygen in Mars's ancient atmosphere is unclear,
                    so how the manganese oxide was formed and concentrated here
                    is really puzzling. These findings point to larger processes
                    occurring in the Martian atmosphere or surface water and
                    shows that more work needs to be done to understand
                    oxidation on Mars," Gasda added.

                    ChemCam, which was developed at Los Alamos and CNES (the
                    French space agency), uses a laser to form a plasma on the
                    surface of a rock, and collects that light in order to
                    quantify elemental composition in rocks.<br />[...]<br />"The
                    Gale lake environment, as revealed by these ancient rocks,
                    gives us a window into a habitable environment that looks
                    surprisingly similar to places on Earth today," said Nina
                    Lanza, principal investigator for the ChemCam instrument.
                    "Manganese minerals are common in the shallow, oxic waters
                    found on lake shores on Earth, and it's remarkable to find
                    such recognizable features on ancient Mars."

                More evidence that Mars was once a warm and wet world. Sadly,
                we'll likely never know whether or not life actually got started

                    A new method to deliver a quality cold brew coffee in less
                    than three minutes solidifies Australia's position as the
                    innovators of modern coffee, according to researchers from

                    Engineers from University New South Wales developed an
                    ultrasonic machine to speed up the cold brew of ground
                    coffee beans—a process that normally takes 12 to 24 hours.
                    The research was published in Ultrasonics Sonochemistry.

                    Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Jaqueline Moura Nadolny said UQ
                    scientists then tested this brew, finding the taste would
                    satisfy fans of cold brew who rave about its smoother, less
                    acidic and less bitter qualities.

                    "Once again, Australia has new technology at our fingertips

                    achieve a taste profile very similar to either a traditional
                    cold brew or an espresso in the time it takes to brew a hot

                    transducer with the brewing basket via a metallic
                    horn—transforming the coffee basket into a powerful
                    ultrasonic reactor.

                  <p>
                    Dr. Trujillo said the ultrasound process speeds up the
                    extraction of the oils, flavors and aroma of the ground
                    coffee.

                    "We're able to demonstrate that this can be adapted to an
                    existing espresso machine," he said. "We are very excited
                    about developing this technology, which can be used by
                    companies that already manufacture coffee machines, so
                    consumers will be able to enjoy a 3-minute ultrasonic cold
                    brew at home. This also opens the door for coffee shops and
                    restaurants to produce on-demand brews comparable to 24-hour
                    cold brews, supplying the rising demand while eliminating
                    the need for large semi-industrial brewing units and
                    extensive refrigeration space."

                    A tokamak in France set a new record in fusion plasma by
                    encasing its reaction in tungsten, a heat-resistant metal
                    that allows physicists to sustain hot plasmas for longer,
                    and at higher energies and densities than carbon tokamaks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The recent achievement was made in WEST (tungsten (W)
                    Environment in Steady-state Tokamak), a tokamak operated by
                    the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission
                    (CEA). WEST was injected with 1.15 gigajoules of power and
                    sustained a plasma of about 50 million degrees Celsius for
                    six minutes. It achieved this record after scientists
                    encased the tokamak's interior in tungsten, a metal with an
                    extraordinarily high melting point. Researchers from
                    Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory used an X-ray detector
                    inside the tokamak to measure aspects of the plasma and the
                    conditions that made it possible."

                    [...] Earlier this year, the Korea Institute of Fusion
                    Energy installed a tungsten diverter in its KSTAR tokamak,
                    replacing the device's carbon diverter. Tungsten has a
                    higher melting point than carbon, and according to Korea's
                    National Research Council of Science and Technology, the new
                    diverter improves the reactor's heat flux limit two-fold.
                    KSTAR's new diverter enabled the institute's team to sustain
                    high-ion temperatures exceeding 100 million degrees Celsius
                    for longer.

                    A maximum severity vulnerability that allows hackers to
                    hijack GitLab accounts with no user interaction required is
                    now under active exploitation, federal government officials
                    warned as data showed that thousands of users had yet to
                    install a patch released in January.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A change GitLab implemented in May 2023 made it possible for
                    users to initiate password changes through links sent to
                    secondary email addresses. The move was designed to permit
                    resets when users didn't have access to the email address
                    used to establish the account. In January, GitLab
                    <a
                      href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/01/11/critical-security-release-gitlab-16-7-2-released/"

                    >
                    that the feature allowed attackers to send reset emails to
                    accounts they controlled and from there click on the
                    embedded link and take over the account.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While exploits require no user interaction, hijackings work
                    only against accounts that aren't configured to use
                    multifactor authentication. Even with MFA, accounts remained
                    vulnerable to password resets, but the attackers ultimately
                    are unable to access the account, allowing the rightful
                    owner to change the reset password. The vulnerability,
                    tracked as CVE-2023-7028, carries a severity rating of 10
                    out of 10.

                    it is aware of "evidence of active exploitation" and added
                    the vulnerability to its list of known exploited
                    vulnerabilities. CISA provided no details about the
                    in-the-wild attacks. A GitLab representative declined to

                    The vulnerability, classified as an improper access control
                    flaw, could pose a grave threat. GitLab software typically
                    has access to multiple development environments belonging to
                    users. With the ability to access them and surreptitiously
                    introduce changes, attackers could sabotage projects or
                    plant backdoors that could infect anyone using software
                    built in the compromised environment. An example of a

                    The 8088 processor communicates over the bus with memory and
                    I/O devices through a highly-structured sequence of steps
                    called "T-states." A typical 8088 bus cycle consists of four
                    T-states, with one T-state per clock cycle. Although a
                    four-step bus cycle may sound straightforward, its
                    implementation uses a complicated state machine making it
                    one of the most difficult parts of the 8088 to explain.
                    First, the 8088 has many special cases that complicate the
                    bus cycle. Moreover, the bus cycle is really six steps, with
                    two undocumented "extra" steps to make bus operations more
                    efficient. Finally, the complexity of the bus cycle is
                    largely arbitrary, a consequence of Intel's attempts to make
                    the 8088's bus backward-compatible with the earlier 8080 and
                    8085 processors. However, investigating the bus cycle
                    circuitry in detail provides insight into the timing of the
                    processor's instructions. In addition, this circuitry
                    illustrates the tradeoffs and implementation decisions that
                    are necessary in a production processor. In this blog post,
                    I look in detail at the circuitry that implements this state
                    machine.

                    [...] On top of that, there's the garbage-in, garbage-out
                    problem. AI trained on narratives provided by officers may
                    take it upon themselves to "correct" narratives that seem to
                    indicate an officer may have done something wrong. It's also
                    going to lend itself to biased policing by tech-washing BS
                    stops by racist cops, portraying these as essential
                    contributions to public safety.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of course, plenty of officers do these sorts of things
                    already, so there's a possibility it won't make anything
                    <em>worse</em>. But if the process Axon is pitching makes
                    things <em>faster</em>, there's no reason to believe what's
                    already wrong with American policing won't get worse in
                    future. And, as the tech improves (so to speak), the
                    exacerbation of existing problems and the problems
                    introduced by the addition of AI will steadily accelerate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's not to say there's no utility in processes that
                    reduce the amount of time spent on paperwork. But it seems
                    splitting off a clerical division might be a better solution
                    — a part of the police force that handles the paperwork and
                    vets camera footage, but is performed by people who are not
                    the same ones who captured the recordings and participated
                    in the traffic stop, investigation, or dispatch call
                    response.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And I will say this for Axon: at least its CEO recognizes
                    the problems this could introduce and suggests agencies
                    limit automated report creation to things like misdemeanors
                    and never in cases where deadly force is deployed. But, like
                    any product, it will be the end users who decide how it's
                    used. And so far, the expected end users are more than
                    willing to streamline things they view as inessential, but
                    are far less interested in curtailing abuse by those using
                    these systems. Waiting to see how things play out just isn't
                    an acceptable option — not when there are actual lives and
                    liberties on the line.

                    A new study reveals that cooperation by bumblebees isn't
                    simply a result of accumulated individual efforts. Rather,
                    these miniature-brained creatures are not just hard-working
                    pollinators, but also show signs of being master
                    collaborators.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study, conducted at the University of Oulu in Finland
                    and published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B,
                    demonstrates the role of teamwork for bumblebees in novel
                    cooperative challenges.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It has previously been thought that understanding the role
                    of a partner in a cooperative task is a complex phenomenon
                    that is mainly characteristic of big-brained mammals such as
                    humans and chimpanzees. But new research shows that even
                    insects can learn and adapt to cooperative tasks.
                    Understanding how collaboration has become so important for
                    humans requires comparisons with other species.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The study's findings challenge conventional notions of
                    insects, and the ability to work together towards a common
                    goal is present even in the miniature brain of bumblebees,"
                    says lead researcher, Associate Professor, Dr. Olli Loukola.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the study, pairs of bumblebees were trained in two
                    different cooperative tasks. Bees learned to simultaneously
                    push a Lego block in the middle of an arena, or to
                    simultaneously push a door at the end of a transparent
                    double tunnel to gain access to rewarding nectar.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bumblebees' behaviors suggest their efforts towards solving
                    the cooperative tasks were influenced by the presence,
                    absence, and movement direction of their partner. When their
                    partner was delayed, bees tended to take longer than
                    controls to initiate pushing and were more likely to push
                    only when their partner pushed with them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In short, bees trained on cooperative tasks seemed to wait
                    for their partner. The bumblebees in the control group,
                    which had been trained alone, did not show similar behavior.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the study, pairs of bumblebees were trained in two
                    different cooperative tasks. Bees learned to simultaneously
                    push a Lego block in the middle of an arena, or to
                    simultaneously push a door at the end of a transparent
                    double tunnel to gain access to rewarding nectar.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bumblebees' behaviors suggest their efforts towards solving
                    the cooperative tasks were influenced by the presence,
                    absence, and movement direction of their partner. When their
                    partner was delayed, bees tended to take longer than
                    controls to initiate pushing and were more likely to push
                    only when their partner pushed with them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In short, bees trained on cooperative tasks seemed to wait
                    for their partner. The bumblebees in the control group,
                    which had been trained alone, did not show similar behavior.

                    On May 3, China launched Chang’e 6, its latest mission to
                    the Moon. Similar to its predecessor, it is a sample
                    retrieval mission, expected to collect up to 2 kilograms
                    (4.4 pounds) of lunar material from the far side of the
                    Moon, the portion that is always facing away from Earth. The
                    whole mission is expected to last 53 days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    China has already broken records on the far side by becoming

                    and only nation to soft-land there with Chang’e 4 in 2019.
                    That mission landed in the Von Kármán crater, which is 180
                    kilometers (110 miles) across and sits within the South
                    Pole-Aitken Basin. Chang’e 6 is targeting another area of
                    the basin: the Apollo crater, which is three times as wide
                    as the Von Kármán.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The interest in this area lies in the distant past of the
                    Moon. Underneath this region, there is

                    >, potentially part of the colossal object that slammed into
                    the Moon and created the basin 4 billion years ago. The
                    jackpot would be to find portions of the lunar mantle and
                    bring them back to Earth.

                  <p>

                    is equipped with a scoop to collect soil and rocks from the
                    surface, as well as a drill to collect subsurface samples.
                    An ascent vehicle will launch the samples into orbit, where
                    it will rendezvous with an orbiter and come back to Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That is not the only focus of the mission, however. The
                    lander and orbiter include scientific payloads from other
                    countries too, which aim to understand dust and outgassing
                    on the Moon, studying lunar magnetism, among other goals.

                    [...] In the US, China’s plans are being seen with increased
                    anxiety. On April 17, the House Appropriations Subcommittee
                    on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies held a
                    hearing about the NASA Budget for 2025. Both the chair,
                    representative Harold Rogers (R-KY), and NASA Administrator
                    Bill Nelson made reference to a new space race.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The National Aeronautics and Space Administration was
                    founded in 1958 in response to the so-called Space Race with
                    the Soviet Union to land the first man on the Moon. Today we
                    find ourselves in yet another space race, this time with
                    China,” Rogers stated during the
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NISFxcWeZNA"
                      >hearing</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “We are in a race,” Nelson replied to a question from Rogers
                    on Chinese plans. “The latest date they've said they're
                    going to land [on the moon] is 2030 but that keeps moving
                    up.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Nelson also said that he believes that the Chinese
                    civilian space program is actually a military program. The
                    comments have been seen as venting a frustration about the
                    comparatively limited budget NASA operates. Others have
                    considered Nelson’s comments as coming across as
                    hypocritical given NASA’s many links to the
                    military-industrial complex and the

                Audioguy was one of the original team who created the existing
                SoylentNews site. He has stayed with us since that time and has
                served the community as a sys-admin for over 10 years. It is no
                exaggeration to say that over the last year or two he has played
                an almost single-handed role in keeping this site working.
              </p>
              <p>
                Audioguy has suffered a series of significant personal and
                medical events over the last 6 months or so. He is now about to
                commence ophthalmic surgery tomorrow (Wednesday) and is facing
                other potentially life changing medical issues in the near
                future. He has, quite understandably and reluctantly, been
                forced to stand down from his role which was effective from late
                last week. Unfortunately that has meant that we have lost the
                ability to correct the current certificates problem. Access to
                the Linode servers is still controlled by the existing Board and
                we have experienced additional problems accessing one of our
                servers by the usual methods. This appears to be common to many
                staff and has further exacerbated the current problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have written an email to NCommander requesting his assistance
                in updating the certificates so that the site becomes fully
                operational again. Your patience is appreciated. What might
                appear to many in the community to be a relatively minor issue
                is, behind the scenes, a major blow to the existing team. We
                have other sys-admins who are ready to pick up the challenge but
                they do not yet have the necessary access, nor are they yet
                experienced in managing the beast that that is Slashd.
              </p>
              <p>
                Returning to audioguy, I am sure that the entire community would
                wish to join me in thanking him for a decade of support to the
                site, and to wish him well for the upcoming surgery. He remains
                one of this community and evidence of his past contributions can
                be found in numerous bits of code and associated documentation.
                He has also, for example, been the manager of the technical wiki
                which has been vital to the support team for all of that period.
                We are indebted to him.
              </p>
              <p>
                Good luck for the future, audioguy. Take it easy. Best wishes to
                you and your family.

                    users’ networks and operations and, in some cases, costing

                  <p>
                    To create the counterfeits, the Chinese suppliers often took
                    older, lower-model products, some of which were previously
                    discarded, and modified them to appear new, while loading
                    pirated Cisco software on the hardware.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The counterfeits looked real enough to fool government
                    buyers. Federal investigators say that some of the fake
                    equipment was used in classified information systems. "The
                    devices were also identified in combat and non-combat
                    operations of the US Navy, US Air Force, and US Army, such
                    as platforms supporting the F-15, F-18, and F-22 fighter
                    jets, AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, P-8 maritime patrol

                    US authorities and Cisco began cracking down on Askoy as
                    early as 2014 by seizing the counterfeit shipments and
                    ordering him to stop. But he was still able to avoid
                    scrutiny by conspiring with his Chinese suppliers to traffic
                    the goods into the US.

                    Following his arrest in 2022, Askoy pleaded guilty to
                    charges related to the fraud scheme a year later. As part of
                    his plea agreement, Aksoy will pay Cisco and his other
                    victims $100 million in restitution for committing the
                    fraud.

                    that ISPs provide low-income state residents $15 broadband
                    at speeds of 25 Mbps. The law was blocked in June of 2021 by

                    Telecom lobbyists have spent years lobbying to ensure
                    federal broadband oversight is as captured and feckless as
                    possible. And, with the

                    <strong>really hoped</strong> they could extend that winning
                    streak even further and bar states from standing up to them

                    One of the things that <em>absolutely terrifies</em> telecom
                    monopoly lobbyists is the idea of rate regulation, or that
                    government would ever stop them from ripping off captive
                    customers stuck in uncompetitive markets. It’s never been a
                    serious threat on the federal level due to regulatory
                    capture and lobbying, even though it’s thrown around
                    <strong>a lot</strong> by monopoly apologists as a
                    terrifying bogeyman akin to leprosy.

                    As humans prepare to return to the moon after an absence of
                    more than half a century, researchers have hit on a radical
                    approach to keeping astronauts fit as they potter around the
                    ball of rock.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To prevent lunar explorers from becoming weak and feeble in
                    the low gravity environment, scientists suggest astronauts
                    go for a run. But, this being space, it's not just any kind
                    of run – researchers have advised astronauts run several
                    times a day around a "lunar Wall of Death".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using a rented Wall of Death – a giant wooden cylinder used
                    by motorcycle stunt performers in their gravity-defying
                    fairground act – a 36m-high telescopic crane, and some
                    bungee cords, researchers showed it was possible for a human
                    to run fast enough in lunar gravity not only to remain on
                    the wall, but to generate sufficient lateral force to combat
                    bone and muscle wasting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I'm amazed that nobody had the idea before," said Alberto
                    Minetti, professor of physiology at the University of Milan.
                    "This could be a convenient way to train on the moon." And
                    easier than building a spinning moon base that generates the
                    force, like the giant wheel of Space Station One in 2001: A
                    Space Odyssey.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The hostile lunar environment presents several
                    challenges, from ensuring astronauts have air, food and
                    water to being well protected against space radiation. But
                    without normal gravity to work against, astronauts lose bone
                    and muscle mass, along with the fine nervous system control
                    needed for coordinated movements, making measures to combat
                    "deconditioning" a priority.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To test the idea, two researchers ran around a
                    10m-wide Wall of Death while attached to a bungee cord
                    suspended from the crane. The set-up emulated lunar gravity
                    by taking five-sixths off their body weight. Combined with
                    treadmill data, the scientists conclude that running for a
                    couple of minutes at the start and end of each day, should
                    generate enough lateral force, or "artificial gravity" to
                    keep bones and muscles strong and maintain good nervous
                    system control.

                  <p>
                    Rather than transporting an actual Wall of Death to the
                    moon, astronauts could be housed in circular habitats,
                    allowing them to run around the walls of their off-world
                    homes, the team write in

                    [...] Bird embryos develop outside the mother's body and can
                    be artificially incubated, so it is possible to manipulate
                    an embryo's experience without manipulating the mother.

                    The research team, led by Dr. Alizée Meillère and Dr. Mylene
                    Mariette from the School of Life and Environmental Sciences
                    at Deakin University (Australia) and Doñana Biological
                    Station (Spain), took advantage of this by playing sounds to
                    the eggs of an Australian native bird, the zebra finch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They discovered that—under otherwise optimal incubation
                    conditions—eggs are less likely to hatch when exposed to
                    traffic noise for five days before hatching, than when
                    exposed to the species native song.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Both traffic noise and song were played at the same
                    moderate amplitude—65 decibels, which is similar to a
                    conversation level—but something about the acoustic
                    characteristics of the noise caused embryonic death," said
                    Dr. Mariette.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Nestlings exposed to noise rather than song were
                    slower to grow and showed more severe signs of cellular
                    damage," said Dr. Mariette. "These negative effects were the
                    result of both previous noise exposure before hatching and
                    current exposure during the nestling stage."

                    [...] As part of these changes, Microsoft will also make its
                    Senior Leadership Team's pay partially dependent on whether
                    the company is "meeting our security plans and milestones,"
                    though Bell didn't specify how much executive pay would be
                    dependent on meeting those security goals.

                    A team of physicists from several institutions across the
                    U.S. working with a colleague from China, at the DIII-D
                    National Fusion Facility, in San Diego, California, has
                    devised a way to overcome two key hurdles standing in the
                    way of using fusion as a general power source.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In their
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07313-3"
                      >paper</a
                    >
                    published in the journal <i>Nature</i>, the group describes
                    how they devised a way to raise the density of the plasma in
                    their reactor while also keeping it stable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It was just in the past couple of years that
                    researchers were able to show that a fusion reaction could
                    be made to sustain itself, and that more power could be
                    produced than was input into such a system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The next two hurdles to overcome are increasing the density
                    of the plasma in the reactor and then containing it for
                    extended periods of time—long enough for it to be useful for
                    producing electricity. In this new study, the research team
                    has devised a way to do both in a tokamak chamber.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To contain the plasma as its density was increased, the team
                    used additional magnets and bursts of deuterium where
                    needed. They also allowed for higher densities at the core
                    than near the edges, helping to ensure the plasma could not
                    escape. They held it in that state for 2.2 seconds, long
                    enough to prove that it could be done.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The research team acknowledges that their experiment
                    was done in a very small reactor—one with a diameter of just
                    1.6 meters. For such an achievement to be considered fully
                    successful, it will have to be done in a much larger
                    reactor, such as the one currently under construction in
                    France, which will have a diameter of 6.2 meters.

                at a ministerial meeting that they will shut down coal-fired
                power plants by 2030-2035, or on a timeline consistent with the
                1.5 C degree temperature limit. In addition, the G7 countries
                announced they will rapidly scale-up battery storage sixfold by
                2030 to support electricity grids powered by renewable energy
                sources.

                The latest G7 statement is not entirely surprising if you've
                been following coal consumption in the countries mentioned. In
                2003, the G7 still were the proud owners of a 44% share in
                global coal-fired electricity. By 2013, that share had lowered
                to 26.5% -- currently it is down to 11%. But still.

              <p>
                For example, Japan imported just over 110 million metric tons of
                thermal coal last year, compared to around 330 million tons
                imported by China and 170 million tons by India. Their current
                suppliers are Australia, Indonesia, Russia and Canada. Some
                fast-growing economies elsewhere, including India, the
                Philippines and Vietnam, may snap up some of the reduced volumes
                bought by G7 nations over the near term. But in the longer run
                those and other nations plan to sharply increase clean power
                generation and cut back on fossil fuel use.

                    Victoria Shi is modelled on Rosalie Nombre, a singer and

                    Ukraine on Wednesday presented an AI-generated spokesperson
                    called Victoria who will make official statements on behalf
                    of its foreign ministry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ministry said it would "for the first time in history"
                    use a digital spokesperson to read its statements, which
                    will still be written by humans.

                    Dressed in a dark suit, the spokesperson introduced herself
                    as Victoria Shi, a "digital person", in a presentation
                    posted on social media. The figure gesticulates with her

                    The foreign ministry's press service said that the
                    statements given by Shi would not be generated by AI but
                    "written and verified by real people".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's only the visual part that the AI helps us to
                    generate," Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister,
                    said, adding that the new spokesperson was a "technological
                    leap that no diplomatic service in the world has yet made".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The main reason for creating her was "saving time and
                    resources" for diplomats, he said. Shi's creators are a team
                    called the Game Changers who have also made virtual-reality
                    content related to the war in Ukraine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The spokesperson's name is based on the word "victory" and
                    the Ukrainian phrase for artificial intelligence:
                    <em>shtuchniy intelekt</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shi's appearance and voice are modelled on a real person:
                    Rosalie Nombre, a singer and former contestant on Ukraine's
                    version of the reality show The Bachelor. Nombre was born in
                    the now Russian-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern
                    Ukraine. She has 54,000 followers on her Instagram account,
                    which she uses to discuss stereotypes about mixed-race
                    Ukrainians and those who grew up as Russian speakers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ministry said that Nombre took part free of charge. It
                    stressed that Shi and Nombre "are two different people" and
                    that only the AI figure will give official statements.

                    It's been a particular problem in healthcare, where broken
                    "AI" is being layered on top of already broken systems. Like
                    in insurance, where error-prone automation, programmed from

                    In the Middle Ages, it was still thought best to isolate
                    those with leprosy from the rest of the population, and one
                    way of doing that was to build special "hospitals" called

                    in the South of England, which also had strong connections
                    to the fur trade. This is where the team sourced the

                    they all belonged to the same branch of the
                    <em>M. leprae </em>family tree, and that the medieval
                    squirrel strain showed greater similarity to medieval human
                    strains than to modern squirrel strains.

                    closely related to medieval human strains from the same city
                    than to strains isolated from infected modern red squirrels.
                    Overall, our results point to an independent circulation of
                    <em>M. leprae</em> strains between humans and red squirrels
                    during the Medieval Period," Schuenemann explained.

                  <p>
                    Sixty years ago, on May 1, 1964, at
                    <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/basicfifty/basic.html"
                      >4 am in the morning</a
                    >, a quiet revolution in computing began at Dartmouth
                    College. That's when mathematicians John G. Kemeny and
                    Thomas E. Kurtz successfully ran the first program written
                    in their newly developed BASIC (Beginner's All-Purpose
                    Symbolic Instruction Code) programming language on the
                    college's General Electric GE-225 mainframe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Little did they know that their creation would go on to
                    democratize computing and inspire generations of programmers
                    over the next six decades.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Prior to BASIC, programming languages like
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a>,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL">Algol</a>, and
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>
                    proved complex and were primarily used by professionals.
                    Kemeny and Kurtz saw a need for amateurs who were not
                    dedicated computer engineers to be able to use computers as
                    well. Their journey to create a more user-friendly language
                    began in 1956 with Dartmouth Simplified Code (<a
                      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARSIMCO"
                      >DARIMSCO</a
                    >), followed by the Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming
                    Experiment (<a
                      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_Oversimplified_Programming_Experiment"
                      >DOPE</a
                    >). While DOPE proved too simple to be of much use, the
                    lessons learned from these projects informed the development
                    of BASIC, which started in 1963.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The impact of BASIC extended far beyond Dartmouth's
                    campus. As part of the deal to buy the GE computer, the
                    undergraduates built the operating system in BASIC for
                    General Electric's version of time-sharing. This allowed
                    colleges, high schools, and individuals across the country
                    to dial into mainframe computers and write programs using
                    BASIC.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1975, Paul Allen and Bill Gates adapted the language for
                    personal computers like the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800"
                      >Altair 8800</a
                    >, expanding its reach to a new audience of small computer
                    owners and founding Microsoft in the process. In 1976, Steve
                    Wozniak

                      >developed a BASIC interpreter from scratch</a
                    >
                    for the Apple I using self-taught methods and minimal
                    resources. This became
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_BASIC"
                      >Integer BASIC</a
                    >
                    for the Apple II a year later, and BASIC (as
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applesoft_BASIC"
                      >Applesoft BASIC</a
                    >) remained a key part of the Apple II throughout the
                    platform's lifespan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Today, BASIC remains popular in hobbyist
                    retrocomputing circles, but few use it as a practical
                    language. And yet it never truly died out—instead, it
                    continued to evolve.

                    The VPN issue affects all currently supported versions of

                    The April 2024 Windows security patch appears to be the
                    culprit for broken Virtual Private Network functionality.
                    The bug prevents users from connecting to a VPN to conceal
                    their home Wi-Fi network's IP address when browsing the web
                    or accessing content from abroad.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft has acknowledged the issue, with the KB5036893
                    that dropped almost a month ago, which it says affects all
                    current versions of Windows 11, Windows 10 and Windows
                    Server. It promises a fix is incoming.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On a support page (via The Verge), the company says: "VPN
                    connections might fail after installing the April 2024
                    security update.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Windows devices might face VPN connection failures after
                    installing the April 2024 security update (KB5036893) or the
                    April 2024 non-security preview update. We are working on a
                    resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming
                    release."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Windows users wait for the resolution, the only known
                    workaround is to roll back the operating system update, and
                    uninstall the update.

                    [....] This is a fairly modernized and refurbished
                    late-1980s single-user GUI-based OS, and that implies some
                    limitations. It was first released the same year as OS/2
                    1.0, long before Apple System 7 or Windows 3.0. In fact,
                    it'll remind you of Windows 3 on MS-DOS: it's a
                    single-tasking text-mode OS, with networking, on top of
                    which is a graphical desktop that does cooperative
                    multitasking. RISC OS gives applications access to much of
                    the memory map, and so if a program accidentally scribbles
                    over the wrong parts of that address space, the whole
                    computer can freeze up – which in testing our Pi 400 did
                    several times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But saying that, it's an admirably complete OS, in this
                    vulture's opinion, with quite a rich portfolio of
                    applications. RISC OS 5.30 comes with a selection of
                    productivity apps, plus development tools, including a
                    choice of editors, Python, Lua, and a C compiler – and of
                    course with a 32-bit version of BBC BASIC V, a fully
                    structured interpreter which also supports inline Arm
                    assembly language.

                    [...] Here, they concluded that flow-mediated interactions
                    between neighbors are, in effect, spring-like forces that
                    hold each member in place—just as if the cars of a train
                    were connected by springs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, these "springs" act in only one direction—a lead
                    bird can exert force on its follower, but not vice versa—and
                    this non-reciprocal interaction means that later members
                    tend to resonate or oscillate wildly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The oscillations look like waves that jiggle the members
                    forwards and backwards and which travel down the group and
                    increase in intensity, causing later members to crash
                    together," explains Joel Newbolt, who was an NYU graduate
                    student in physics at the time of research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team named these new types of waves "flonons," which is
                    based on the similar concept of phonons that refer to
                    vibrational waves in systems of masses linked by springs and
                    which are used to model the motions of atoms or molecules in
                    crystals or other materials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our findings therefore raise some interesting connections
                    to material physics in which birds in an orderly flock are
                    analogous to atoms in a regular crystal," Newbolt adds.

                    Lewis and Tolkien shared a love of Norse mythology, and
                    Lewis read the first early drafts of what would become
                    Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien later said he
                    owed his friend "an unpayable debt" for convincing him the
                    "stuff" could be more than merely a "private hobby."
                    Tolkien, in turn, was the one who convinced Lewis—an atheist
                    in his youth—to convert to Christianity.

                    [...] "Since Þrýþ was wicked and her mood was fierce,
                    according to Tolkien's interpretation and translation that
                    Lewis seems to agree with, the negative phrase in the title
                    of the poem can only be read as a compliment to Ida Gordon,"
                    Cossio wrote. Taken together with Lewis's adherence to the
                    alliterative meter of Beowulf, Cossio concludes that the
                    newly discovered poem was clearly written "from one
                    medievalist to another."

                    About a month ago, a developer notified The Register (<i
                      >El Reg</i
                    >, for the <i>conoscenti</i>) that part of the documentation
                    of an AI powered infrastructure-as-code tool was turning up
                    on the Internet. Problem: the documentation itself was
                    written by an LLM and, as one has come to expect, it
                    <i>sometimes</i> hallucinated. In layman terms: it shoveled
                    bullshit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The developer -- Pete Nykänen -- had opened an issue with
                    the company on Github, but no action was taken.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    and found that the story was true. What's more, the bogus
                    content ended up number one in Google's search results, and
                    pretty high-up almost everywhere else too. Intrigued, El Reg
                    investigators asked both the Google and the original AI
                    polluter for comment, which led to some interesting quotes.

                    They even planned to refer to existing APIs and

                    How they're going to do that -- given their proven ability
                    in planning ahead and stuff -- is probably merely a question
                    of filling in the blanks when asking the question to their
                    own AI engine, one supposes.

                    Google was a bit slower in responding -- by about a month or

                    A new type of printed circuit board (PCB) could drastically
                    reduce the amount of electronic waste that ends up in
                    landfills. Although most PCBs are difficult to recycle, such
                    is not the case with this one, which partially turns into a
                    reusable jelly when necessary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among other components, PCBs typically incorporate a layer
                    of non-conductive fiberglass which serves as a substrate for
                    electronic parts such as chips, resistors and transformers.
                    The fiberglass is in turn made up of two ingredients – woven
                    glass fibers and epoxy resin – which are very difficult to
                    separate from one another.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because this substrate material can't be easily broken down,
                    retrieving the electronics for reuse is labor-intensive and
                    time-consuming. Sometimes the fiberglass is burned away in
                    order to harvest the electronics, but this process is
                    environmentally-unfriendly plus it may damage the very
                    components that it's freeing up.
                  </p>
                  <p>That's where the experimental new PCB comes in.</p>
                  <p>
                    Created by scientists from the University of Washington, it
                    replaces the resin in the fiberglass with a polymer known as
                    a vitrimer. As long as the PCB is in use, that vitrimer
                    remains strong, rigid and non-conductive, allowing the
                    substrate to function just like one made of traditional
                    fiberglass.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once such a "vPCB" (vitrimer printed circuit board) has
                    reached the end of its use, it will be sent to a recycling
                    facility and immersed in an organic solvent which has a
                    relatively low boiling point. When that solvent boils, it
                    causes the vitrimer to swell and become gelatinous.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All of the glass fibers and electronics – which remain
                    completely undamaged – can then be easily plucked out for
                    reuse. Additionally, lab experiments have shown that 98% of
                    the vitrimer itself can be reused, along with 91% of the
                    solvent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And importantly, vPCBs can be manufactured at existing
                    facilities, plus they can be recycled over and over again.
                    In fact, the scientists estimate that the use of recycled
                    vPCBs could entail a 48% reduction in global warming
                    potential and an 81% reduction in carcinogenic emissions as
                    compared to traditional PCBs.

                  <p>
                    Perhaps most significant is the discovery of five cursus
                    monuments. Cursus monuments are long, narrow earthwork
                    enclosures and are well-known from the Middle Neolithic in
                    Britain, but have not been well-studied in Ireland.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This discovery is one of the largest cursus clusters in both
                    Britain and Ireland, and infers that Baltinglass continued
                    to be intensively settled between the Early Neolithic and
                    late Bronze Age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This latest LIDAR survey greatly enhances of understanding
                    of the incredibly rich archaeological heritage of this part
                    of west Wicklow; reinforcing the significance of the
                    prehistoric landscape of the Baltinglass Hills area and
                    shining new light on rare and poorly understood monuments
                    like ceremonial cursus," states Deirdre Burns, Heritage
                    Officer at Wicklow County Council.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Importantly, these cursus monuments are clearly aligned with
                    burial monuments in the landscape, as well as the rising and
                    setting sun during major solar events such as the solstice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Dr. O'Driscoll, "This may have symbolized the
                    ascent of the dead into the heavens and their perceived
                    rebirth, with the cursus physically setting out the final
                    route of the dead, where they left the land of the living
                    and joined the ancestors beyond the visible horizon."
