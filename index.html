                    The global market for refurbished and used mobile phones is
                    expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.45%
                    from 2022 to 2030. This means it can move from $52.34
                    billion in 2021 to $64.10 billion in 2022. Several estimates
                    list the US as the fastest growing market for refurbished
                    and used mobile phones. A refurbished phone goes through a
                    process of quality check however, used phones can be dead at
                    the time of selling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some of the key players who champion the market of
                    refurbished and used phones are Apple Inc., Amazon, Samsung,
                    Version Communications, and Cashify. Besides these, Walmart,
                    eBay, Paytm, Huawei, Yaantra, and AT&amp;T Inc. are close
                    contenders. Seeing the brands of phones while making a
                    purchase is not enough to escape falling into legal
                    complications.

                  <p>
                    Africa and Australia have large swathes of sandy coastline
                    and coastal wetlands. By contrast, Europe and Russia's cold
                    coastline lacks mangroves or tropical coastal wetlands.
                    These differences drive the changes we found in how
                    different coasts take up or emit greenhouse gases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The strongest coastal greenhouse gas sink is Southeast Asia,
                    because of its extensive and productive tropical mangrove
                    forests and seagrasses which soak up large amounts of CO₂.
                    North America's coast is another excellent sink for
                    greenhouse gases, with its salt marshes, mangroves,
                    seagrasses—and Canada's fjords, glacier-made valleys filled
                    with seawater.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Australia and New Zealand have long stretches of
                    coastal wetlands soaking up CO₂, this is offset by a large
                    number of estuaries, many of which are a source of
                    greenhouse gases produced by decaying organic matter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Coasts in Europe and Russia actually release more greenhouse
                    gases than they absorb. Their many polluted tidal estuaries
                    release greenhouse gases, but the colder climate means this
                    region has fewer coastal wetlands to soak these gases back
                    up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But across the three main greenhouse gases, eight out of the
                    ten world coastal regions are a net greenhouse gas sink.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some coasts soak up greenhouse gases while others emit more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] And by reducing nutrient overload, organic matter and
                    wastewater flows into our coastal waterways, we can cut the
                    greenhouse gases emitted by polluted estuaries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Protecting our coasts is good for us, for nature and
                    for the earth system as it plunges into the climate crisis.

                    Mandiant says that not only do hackers regularly  adapt and
                    make use of red team tools to facilitate real-world attacks,
                    but its analysis of CosmicEnergy reveals that the malware's
                    functionality is also comparable to that of other malware
                    variants targeting industrial control systems (ICS), such as
                    Industroyer, thus posing a "plausible threat to affected
                    electric grid assets."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mandiant tells TechCrunch that it has not observed any
                    CosmicEnergy attacks in the wild and notes that the malware
                    lacks discovery capabilities, which means hackers would need
                    to perform some internal reconnaissance to obtain
                    environment information, such as IP addresses and
                    credentials, before launching an attack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the researchers added that because the malware
                    targets the IEC-104, a network protocol commonly used in
                    industrial environments that was also targeted during the
                    2016 attack on Ukraine's power grid, CosmicEnergy poses a
                    real threat to organizations involved in electricity
                    transmission and distribution.

                    in a bad way. To me, the lab-grown burger had a strong
                    resemblance to the one from Impossible Foods. The texture
                    was similar, which makes sense since it was mostly made from
                    plants.

                    Taste-wise, I thought the lab-grown meat may have been a bit
                    closer to the beef burger, but I found myself wondering if
                    I'd feel the same way if I didn't know which was which. Was
                    my brain tricking me into thinking it tasted more like meat,
                    since I knew that there were animal cells in it? I took
                    bites of all three burgers again to try to figure it out.

                    to be, what the climate impacts will actually look like, and

                    [...] Unfortunately, the lawsuits have had little effect on
                    the overall number of phishing attacks and phishing-related
                    domains, which have steadily increased in volume over the
                    years.  Piscitello said the phishers tend to gravitate
                    toward registrars that offer the least resistance and lowest
                    price per domain. And with

                  <p>
                    "The abuse of a new top-level domain is largely the result
                    of one registrar's portfolio," Piscitello told
                    KrebsOnSecurity. "Alibaba or Namecheap or another registrar
                    will run a promotion for a cheap domain, and then we'll see
                    flocking and migration of the phishers to that TLD. It's
                    like strip mining, where they'll buy hundreds or thousands
                    of domains, use those in a campaign, exhaust that TLD and
                    then move on to another provider."

                  <p>
                    Piscitello said despite the steep drop in phishing domains
                    coming out of Freenom, the alternatives available to
                    phishers are many. After all, there are more than 2,000
                    accredited domain registrars, not to mention dozens of
                    services that let anyone set up a website for free without
                    even owning a domain.

                    "There is no evidence that the trend line is even going to
                    level off," he said. "I think what the Meta lawsuit tells us
                    is that litigation is like giving someone a

                      >standing eight count</a
                    >. It temporarily disrupts a process. And in that sense,
                    litigation appears to be working."

                      >Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey</a
                    >, Paras decided to crash the registration website so that
                    no one could enroll.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On Wednesday night, 19 November 2014, at 10:00 p.m. EST—as
                    the registration period for first-year students in spring
                    courses had just opened—Paras launched his first distributed
                    denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. He had assembled an army of
                    some 40,000 bots, primarily in Eastern Europe and China, and
                    unleashed them on the Rutgers central authentication server.
                    The botnet sent thousands of fraudulent requests to
                    authenticate, overloading the server. Paras's classmates
                    could not get through to register.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Paras was furious that Rutgers chose Incapsula, a
                    small cybersecurity firm based in Massachusetts, as its
                    DDoS-mitigation provider. He claimed that Rutgers chose the
                    cheapest company. "Just to show you the poor quality of
                    Incapsula's network, I have gone ahead and decimated the
                    Rutgers network (and parts of Incapsula), in the hopes that
                    you will pick another provider that knows what they are
                    doing."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Paras's fourth attack on the Rutgers network, taking place
                    during finals, caused chaos and panic on campus. Paras
                    reveled in his ability to shut down a major state
                    university, but his ultimate objective was to force it to
                    abandon Incapsula. Paras had started his own DDoS-mitigation
                    service, ProTraf Solutions, and wanted Rutgers to pick
                    ProTraf over Incapsula. And he wasn't going to stop
                    attacking his school until it switched.

                    Despite their apparent success, LLMs are not (really)
                    'models of language' but are statistical models of the
                    regularities found in linguistic communication. Models and
                    theories should explain a phenomenon (e.g., F = ma) but LLMs
                    are not explainable because explainability requires
                    structured semantics and reversible compositionality that
                    these models do not admit (see
                    <a
                      href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/264604-new-research-vindicates-fodor-and-pylyshyn-no-explainable-ai-without-structured-semantics/fulltext"

                    for more details). In fact, and due to the subsymbolic
                    nature of LLMs, whatever 'knowledge' these models acquire
                    about language will always be buried in billions of
                    microfeatures (weights), none of which is meaningful on its
                    own. In addition to the lack of explainability, LLMs will
                    always generate biased and toxic language since they are
                    susceptible to the biases and toxicity in their training
                    data (<a
                      href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922"
                      >Bender et. al., 2021</a
                    >). Moreover, and due to their statistical nature, these
                    systems will never be trusted to decide on the
                    "truthfulness" of the content they generate (<a
                      href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03494"
                      >Borji, 2023</a
                    >) – LLMs ingest text and they cannot decide which fragments
                    of text are true and which are not. Note that none of these
                    problematic issues are a function of scale but are
                    paradigmatic issues that are a byproduct of the architecture
                    of deep neural networks (DNNs) and their training
                    procedures. Finally, and contrary to some misguided
                    narrative, these LLMs do not have human-level understanding
                    of language (for lack of space we do not discuss here the
                    limitations of LLMs regarding their linguistic competence,

                    commonsense reasoning that these models will always have

                    of how dangerous these systems are to humanity.

                    So enjoy the news about "the potential danger of AI". But
                    watch and read this news like you're watching a really funny
                    sitcom. Make a nice drink (or a nice cup of tea), listen and
                    smile. And then please, sleep well, because all is OK, no
                    matter what some self-appointed god fathers say. They might
                    know about LLMs, but they apparently never heard of BDIs.

                The author's conclusion seems to be that although AI may pose a
                threat to certain professions, it doesn't endanger the existence
                of humanity.

                    NAND, Tanguy explains, is happiest within a relatively
                    narrow temperature band. "NAND flash actually likes to be
                    'hot' in that 60° to 70° [celcius] range in order to program
                    a cell because when it's that hot, those electrons can move
                    a little bit easier," he explained.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Go a little too hot — say 80°C — and things become
                    problematic, however. At these temps, you risk the SSD's
                    built-in safety mechanisms forcibly powering down the system
                    to prevent damage. However, before this happens users are
                    likely to see the performance of their drives plummet, as
                    the SSD's controller throttles itself to prevent data loss.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The latter is one of the reasons why even during the PCIe
                    4.0 generation it wasn't uncommon to see aluminum or even
                    copper heatsinks sold alongside premium models.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The takeaway is that with PCIe 5.0 SSDs — the performance
                    oriented models in particular — some kind of cooler is
                    necessary to achieve peak performance. Whether it needs to
                    be actively cooled is another question entirely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There's also the potential for these SSD's larger
                    coolers to interfere with other components, like CPU tower
                    coolers or GPUs. This is because the majority of PCIe 5.0
                    slots are located just below the CPU socket to minimize
                    trace length to ensure signal integrity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, do you really need a liquid cooled SSD? Probably not,
                    but if you want one anyway, we can't say we blame you.

                    The report blamed the cost increases on "assumptions that
                    the use of heritage technologies from the Space Shuttle and
                    Constellation Programs were expected to result in
                    significant cost and schedule savings compared to developing
                    new systems for the SLS." Instead, integrating new systems
                    with the older components ended up being more complex,
                    according to the report.

                        NASA is trying to decrease SLS costs moving forward,
                        with the projected 30 percent price dip per engine,
                        "however, those savings do not capture overhead and
                        other costs," the report stated. Each rocket launch
                        requires four engines and two boosters; one RS-25 engine
                        currently costs around $100 million to manufacture and
                        NASA wants to keep sending crews to the Moon to
                        establish a lunar presence. The Artemis 2 mission is
                        currently slated for launch in late 2024, while Artemis
                        3 is meant to follow in 2025 or 2026.

                    In March, the agency told Wyden's office that it had a new
                    policy to restrict the promotion of these types of products
                    in the works — but ITA refused to share that policy without
                    a formal request.

                  <p>
                    Wyden didn't hesitate. In a letter [<a

                      >PDF</a
                    >] on Friday, he asked the agency to see the policy, and
                    also demanded that ITA provide a ton of details about the
                    surveillance technology companies it works with, and how it
                    makes decisions about which businesses to assist.

                    "As you know, the Biden administration has recognized that
                    surveillance technologies are frequently used by governments
                    to invade the privacy of their citizens, enable violence and

                    The majority of the young people interviewed told us they
                    were only taught the basics about consent—along the lines of
                    "no means no, and yes means yes." As interviewee Miles* (17)
                    told us:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's always broadly talked about [...] but it's never
                    actually talked about what it means and what it actually
                    is."
                  </p>
                  <p>Nicola (16) added:</p>
                  <p>
                    "It was more just like if someone says 'no," 'stop' or
                    things like that and if you don't like it say 'no' and
                    things instead of the depths of it."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Consent is complex, so teaching it without necessary detail
                    or context can have devastating results. Some young people
                    may feel unable to say "no" safely in unwanted sexual
                    experiences, and others are genuinely unaware a sexual act
                    occurring, may not be consensual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the same time, teens also felt like the focus was on
                    consent at the expense of other information and topics. As
                    Tiffany (14) said,
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The whole thing is consent, 'cos that's such a big thing
                    nowadays [...] we haven't been taught about sex."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Interviewees also felt current sex education was
                    overwhelmingly fear-based and focused on safety. As
                    15-year-old Lauren explained, she and her classmates had
                    been taught "what could go wrong and not anything else."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "They talk more about sexual violence and sexual assault
                    than they do about sex itself and the benefits of sex and
                    pleasure [...]. It makes it feel like it's bad to have sex
                    and that there's no pleasure in it and it's harmful."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The focus was on risk and biological aspects also left many
                    students confused in terms of how to navigate real-life
                    sexual scenarios safely. As Caris (15) explained:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's hard not knowing what to do and where to put yourself
                    and how to move and all of that. It's hard for teenagers and
                    they don't feel comfortable going to their parents."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Warren (17) said this meant teenagers were going online to
                    find more information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The lack of education causes the younger generation to
                    resort to online personal education therefore resulting in
                    more negative or destructive sexual encounters."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This echoes a

                      >2021–22 national survey</a
                    >, which found 95% of young Australians thought sex
                    education was an important part of the curriculum. But only
                    24.8% said their most recent class was "very" or "extremely"
                    relevant to them.

                  <p>
                    Young people interviewed also felt like their educators did
                    not have enough training to be teaching about relationships
                    and sexuality, which is taught as part of

                    from the first year of school to Year 10. As Nicola said,
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's strange they have sport teachers teaching it, it's not
                    a designated teacher for that program. I think it makes a
                    lot more sense if it's someone who actually is
                    knowledgeable."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There's a common misconception that discussing sex
                    encourages young people to have sex earlier. However,
                    <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/5/e014791"
                      >research suggests</a
                    >
                    the opposite and information can actually delay sexual
                    activity. Recent
                    <a
                      href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14681811.2023.2169825"
                      >research</a
                    >
                    also shows Australian parents want schools to tackle sex and
                    relationships in more detail and from an early age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, schools need to be able to listen to the
                    concerns of teens to meet their real needs around sex
                    education in ways that are healthy, safe and relevant.

                    The scientists also developed an automatic closed-loop

                    the mice in the induced torpor if they showed signs of

                    was targeted. Chen said the result was "surprising and

                    In humans, inducing a torpor-like state has potential
                    medical applications, with some suggesting that slowing down
                    metabolism could buy critical time for treating
                    life-threatening conditions such as heart attack and stroke.
                    "By extending the window for medical intervention, this
                    technique offers promising prospects for improving patients'
                    chances of survival," said Chen. "Additionally, the
                    non-invasive nature of the technique opens the possibility
                    of developing wearable ultrasound devices, such as helmets,
                    for easy access in emergency situations."

                    It comes as New Zealanders battle the ongoing cost of living
                    crisis, with food prices 12.5 percent higher in April this
                    year compared to 2022. The surging costs reflected higher
                    prices for fruit and vegetables, eggs and potato chips,
                    according to Stats New Zealand.

                    This increase was the largest since September 1987, which
                    included the introduction of GST in 1986.

                    Fruit and vegetable prices surged 22.5 percent year-on-year
                    and grocery prices were up 14 percent.

                    The skyrocketing prices have seen many Kiwis turn to BNPL
                    schemes to afford the basics. BNPL companies typically offer
                    on-the-spot, interest-free short-term loans with minimal
                    credit checks that spread payments over weeks or months and
                    are largely used by cash-strapped people taking debt,
                    sometimes more than they can afford.

                      >failed Hakuto-R lunar landing</a
                    >, and it sounds like tricky terrain and a late change in
                    the landing site are to blame. Apparently, Hakuto-R was able
                    to complete the whole deceleration process in preparation of
                    touching down on lunar soil. The spacecraft activated its
                    descent sequence when it reached an altitude of around 100
                    kilometers (62 miles) and was able to slow down until it was
                    only moving at a speed of less than 1 m/s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, its software had mistakenly estimated its altitude
                    to be zero when it was still hovering around 5 kilometers (3
                    miles) above the ground. In other words, it thought it had
                    already landed when it hasn't yet, and it continued
                    descending at a very slow speed near the surface until its
                    propulsion system ran out of fuel. ispace wasn't able to
                    establish contact with the spacecraft again, but it believes
                    it went on a free fall and ultimately crashed on the moon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's the how, but what about the why? Well, the company
                    thinks the most likely reason why Hakuto-R's software
                    suffered from an altitude estimation issue was because it
                    got confused. While it was flying to its landing site, it
                    passed over a large cliff that was determined to be the rim
                    of a crater. The spacecraft's onboard sensor got an altitude
                    reading of 3 kilometers when it passed by the elevated
                    terrain, and that was apparently larger than the estimated
                    altitude value the Hakuto-R team set in advance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The spacecraft's software erroneously thought that the
                    sensor reported an abnormal value, and it kept filtering out
                    its altitude measurements afterward. ispace built the
                    ability to reject abnormal altitude measurements into the
                    lander as a safety measure in the event of a hardware issue
                    with the sensor. However, it backfired for Mission 1 because
                    simulations of the landing sequence failed to incorporate
                    the lunar environment on the spacecraft's route. ispace made
                    the decision to change Hakuto-R's landing site after its
                    critical design review was already completed in 2021.

                    To create a form, for example, users can simply describe the
                    kind of form that they need and Copilot will build it and
                    auto-generate the necessary backend database tables. Those
                    tables can then be edited, removed or added to using natural
                    language within Copilot.

                    language and use Copilot suggestions to design web pages,
                    create content and build complex business data forms for
                    your website," Sangya Singh, VP of Power Pages at Microsoft,
                    told TechCrunch in an email interview. "You no longer need
                    to start from a blank slate."

                    Generating a website with AI isn't exactly a novel idea —

                    can handle copy, images, layouts and more, while generators
                    like Mixo can create basic splash pages given a short
                    description.

                  <p>
                    But Singh paints Copilot in Power Pages as more versatile
                    than the competing solutions out there, while stressing that
                    it's not a tool that could — or should — be used to generate

                    assistant' to a human website maker — hence the name Copilot
                    — where the maker can ask for suggestions on how to build
                    different components of a business data-centric site," she
                    added. "Giving the makers 'total control' is a principle we

            <div class="text">
              <p>
                I'm going to simply write this quickly now. I have had very long
                discussions with a member of the community known as kolie who
                has been negotiating to try and keep SN operational, and help
                provide a realistic plan for both rebuilding the site, and
                migration. I was approached <b>after</b> the shutdown post was
                put up via public contact information. He has offered help in
                the form of hosting, capital, and helping coding a replacement
                for rehash. He has convinced me that there are enough people in
                the community that it might be possible to pay down the
                technical debt.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was asked to formally take the gun off SN's head, since it
                doesn't help recruit volunteers if there's a death sentence.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am more than a little reluctance to do this, simply on the
                basis that there has been a long history on this site of saying
                "we'll do X", and then X never happens. The situation was also
                discussed prior with Matt, and quite a few other people before I
                finally made the decision after it became clear to me that the
                situation had become completely untenable. I spent weeks looking
                for an alternative before I finally resided myself that there
                were no other viable options. But sometimes you can be wrong,
                and sometimes you can get outside help.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of my cited reasons for shutting down SN was that calls for
                help were left unanswered. However, said call finally got
                answered and came at the 11th hour, and as an unsolicited DM by
                someone who wanted to see the site go on. We have been
                discussing this at length since Monday, in a conversation that
                at this point has been longer than everything said in a private,
                staff channel for the last six months. So, I accept the
                possibility I can be wrong. More specifically, I hope I am
                wrong.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, ultimately, I will put my faith in someone I have never met
                before. It might be absurd sounding, but that is ultimately how
                SN started. A bunch of people who never met coming together to
                make a replacement for Slashdot. I will take steps to keep SN
                going past the 30th. This may involve the legal entity changing,
                as the PBC already voted to dissolve itself. I will write more
                on this next week, since frankly, I need time to sit back and
                reflect. I also need to write some emails.
              </p>
              <p>
                The staff have told me that they will not work with me going
                forward. For my part, the feeling is mutual.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are also the facts that I listed in the shutdown letter.
                SN's codebase is effectively unmaintained since the departure of
                TMB. I've already discussed the state of infrastructure to
                death, but there's an objective truth here: SN's VMs were
                exposed to the open Internet on end-of-life operating systems
                for years and the database cluster had been in an extended
                failure with corrupted log tables. As I see it, the staff
                allowed SN to degrade to the point that it was about to entirely
                fail. As I understand it, they see me as acting rashly and
                irresponsibly in attempting to address the situation. I freely
                admitted I could have done better.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of the day, the only worse outcome than a volunteer
                shutdown is one where the site is either compromised, or lost in
                a crash. SN was one hard shutdown from an unrecoverable cluster
                failure.
              </p>
              <p>
                That is not a viable state of affairs. That is a liability
                nightmare that at the end of the day the PBC is responsible for,
                which was the basis on which I intervened.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, I'm only still here because SN has never been able to
                accommodate people leaving, especially as no one has
                historically been willing to take over legal responsibility for
                the operation of the site. I resigned three years ago. SN needs
                actual governance by people who can ultimately say that Z, Y,
                and X need to be done, and have the ability to either have it
                done, or can help raise the money to help get it done.
              </p>
              <p>So, I guess we'll see if miracles happen twice.</p>

                    Saturn's rings might have formed while trilobites scuttled
                    about on Earth. Space dust has been accumulating on the icy
                    halos for no more than 400 million years, researchers report
                    in the May 12 Science Advances.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 4.5-billion-year-old planet appears to have acquired its
                    iconic ornamentation relatively recently, says physicist
                    Sascha Kempf of the University of Colorado Boulder. "We're
                    quite lucky to see a ring in the first place."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The rings of Saturn are made of countless icy particles,
                    which become covered with dust as tiny meteoroids strike
                    them. These dustings darken the rings' complexion, like mud
                    sullies snow on roads in winter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The age of the rings has been debated for decades
                    [...]. Even after the new study, there's still disagreement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the rings are somehow losing dust over time, they could
                    be ancient, says planetary scientist Aurélien Crida of
                    Université Côte d'Azur in Nice, France, who was not involved
                    in the study. "Possibly as old as Saturn."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It seems clear that the rings have been exposed to
                    micrometeoroid impacts for at least a hundred million years,
                    Crida says. But simulations of the rings' formation from the
                    gravitational shredding of an early moon suggest their size
                    is consistent with an age of billions of years, he says. And
                    researchers have reported silicate grains falling from the
                    rings into Saturn's atmosphere (SN: 10/4/18). Some
                    unidentified process might be cleaning the rings of the
                    micrometeoroid dust, making them appear younger than they
                    are, Crida says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Experiments that smash micrometeoroids into ice
                    particles could help resolve the discrepancy, Crida says.
                    For now, the debate over the age of the rings lives on.

                    leadership roles when people quit and guide decisions about
                    who should be promoted. The data can also identify
                    favoritism and bias in hiring and promotion.

                    [...] "If that coastal migration correlates with building
                    new infrastructure along the coast, it's very likely that we
                    will see a change in land elevation," says Virginia Tech
                    environmental security expert Manoochehr Shirzaei, who did
                    the previous study of subsidence on the East Coast. (He
                    wasn't part of this research team but reviewed their paper
                    for the journal.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A major concern for coastal areas, Shirzaei says, is the
                    deformation of floodplains. "The area has to have a certain
                    slope, so if there is heavy precipitation, water drains,"
                    Shirzaei says. "But when you have structures that create
                    localized subsidence, it temporarily changes the slope of
                    the floodplains. So it means that water would sit there for
                    longer periods of time." This essentially creates a great
                    big bowl for heavy rainfall to fill, which can flood roads
                    and buildings. Even worse, climate change is already causing

                    can help. When wetlands are healthy, they receive silt from
                    rivers, which replenishes the sediment. Wetlands also act
                    like natural sea walls, absorbing storm surges and keeping
                    them from inundating cities. Restoring these ecosystems will
                    simultaneously boost biodiversity and turn coastal lands
                    from a liability into a tool for adapting to the twin
                    threats of subsidence and rising sea levels.

                    But in many places, such mitigation efforts will have a hard
                    time keeping up with the pace of coastal development. "A lot
                    of people for obvious reasons want to live on coasts, where
                    there's opportunities," says Parsons. "The growth of people
                    means growth of construction and groundwater demands, so
                    we're likely to see this accelerate."

                    Scientists have invented a device that can continuously
                    generate electricity from thin air, offering a glimpse of a
                    possible sustainable energy source that can be made of
                    almost any material and runs on the ambient humidity that
                    surrounds all of us, reports a new study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The novel "air generator," or Air-gen, is made from
                    materials with holes that are under 100 nanometers in
                    length, which is a scale thousand times smaller than a human
                    hair. This design can pull electricity from water droplets
                    in the air for much longer periods than previous concepts,
                    the researchers report, suggesting that it could eventually
                    provide a continuous and sustainable source of power.
                    Researchers hope the technique could eventually help to
                    fight climate change by serving as an alternative to fossil
                    fuels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Now, researchers at the University of Massachusetts,
                    Amherst, have developed an Air-gen device that yields
                    electricity from contact with water droplets that pass
                    through its porous material. In this way, the Air-gen
                    technology creates "a spontaneous and sustained charging
                    gradient for continuous electric output" that "opens a wide
                    door for the broad exploration of sustainable electricity
                    from ambient air," according to
                    <a
                      href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202300748"
                      >a study published on Wednesday</a
                    >
                    in Advanced Materials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Indeed, the results revealed that practically any
                    material could become an Air-gen device provided it was
                    perforated with tiny holes measuring 100 nanometers or
                    fewer. At this scale, the holes are big enough to allow
                    water to pass through an upper chamber into a lower chamber,
                    but are small enough that the droplets make contact with the
                    material as they move down through the holes. As a
                    consequence, a charge imbalance is created in the device
                    because the water droplets increase the charge of the upper
                    layer by soaking it as they move into the lower chamber.

                    The boss of the company behind ChatGPT has said it might

                    "The current draft of the EU AI Act would be
                    over-regulating," OpenAI's Sam Altman said,
                    <a

                  <p>
                    Many in the creative industries accuse AI companies of using
                    the work of artists, musicians and actors to train systems
                    to imitate their work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Mr Altman is worried it would be technically impossible
                    for OpenAI to comply with some of the AI Act's safety and
                    transparency requirements, according to
                    <a href="https://time.com/6282325/sam-altman-openai-eu/"

                  <p>
                    At an event at University College London, Mr Altman added he
                    was optimistic AI could create more jobs and reduce
                    inequality.

                    companies DeepMind and Anthropic to discuss the technology's
                    risks - from disinformation to national security and even
                    "existential threats" - and the voluntary actions and
                    regulation required to manage them.

                    [...] Mosquitoes have a keen ability to detect heat and are
                    naturally drawn toward it. This means that if you've
                    recently exercised or have a high metabolism, you may be
                    more attractive to mosquitoes than others. The higher your
                    body temperature, the more likely you are to attract these
                    pesky insects. Even if you don't have type-O blood, you are
                    still at higher risk of a mosquito bite.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It is estimated that pregnant women attract twice as
                    many mosquito bites compared to other people due to these
                    factors combined. It's important for expecting mothers to
                    take precautions against mosquito bites during pregnancy, as
                    they may be at risk of contracting diseases like Zika virus
                    or West Nile, which can have serious consequences for both
                    mother and baby if left untreated. No matter what your blood
                    type, avoiding mosquito bites during pregnancy is wise.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Research indicates that what you eat may influence the
                    amount of mosquitoes that are drawn to you. A single
                    12-ounce bottle of beer may increase the likelihood of being
                    bitten by mosquitoes, possibly because alcohol raises skin
                    temperature or emits volatile organic compounds. People on
                    ketotic diets may be more attractive to mosquitoes due to
                    the presence of ketones in their bodies, which act as an
                    attractant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Mosquitoes are notorious for being attracted to
                    humans, but did you know that the color of your clothes can
                    make a difference in how likely you are to get bitten?
                    According to research, mosquitoes have a preference for dark
                    colors. While their sense of sight isn't as sharp as their
                    sense of smell, they use vision to locate humans and
                    identify potential prey. Dark objects stand out more against
                    lighter backgrounds, making them easier targets for
                    mosquitoes.

                    Jovian lightning emits radio wave pulses that are typically
                    separated by about one millisecond, researchers report May

                    Arcs of lightning on both worlds appear to move somewhat
                    like a winded hiker going up a mountain, pausing after each
                    step to catch their breath, says Ivana Kolmašová, an
                    atmospheric physicist at the Czech Academy of Sciences in
                    Prague. "One step, another step, then another step ... and
                    so on."

                    Here on Earth, lightning forms as turbulent winds within
                    thunderclouds cause many ice crystals and water droplets to
                    rub together, become charged and then move to opposite sides
                    of the clouds, progressively generating static electrical
                    charges. When the charges grow big enough to overcome the
                    air's ability to insulate them, electrons are released — the
                    lightning takes its first step. From there, the surging
                    electrons will repeatedly ionize the air and rush into it,
                    lurching the bolt forward at an average of hundreds of
                    thousands of meters per second.

                    might also form by collisions between ice crystals and water
                    droplets (<em>SN: 8/5/20</em>). But no one knew whether the
                    alien lightning extended and branched in increments, as they
                    do on Earth, or if they took some other form.

                    [...] If that universality is real, it could have
                    implications for the search for life elsewhere. Experiments
                    have shown that lightning strikes on Earth could have
                    smelted some of the

                    >). If lightning is discharging in a similar way on alien
                    worlds, Yair says, then it could be producing similar
                    ingredients in those places too.

                    Virgin Orbit will cease operations and sell its assets to
                    four winning bidders, the company announced Tuesday. Those
                    bidders include three aerospace companies—Rocket Lab,
                    Stratolaunch and Vast Space subsidiary Launcher—with
                    combined bids totaling almost $36 million, according to
                    court documents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A sale hearing for court approval is scheduled for Wednesday
                    afternoon and transactions are expected to close soon after,
                    the company said.

                    "Virgin Orbit's legacy in the space industry will forever be
                    remembered," Virgin Orbit said in a Tuesday statement. "Its
                    groundbreaking technologies, relentless pursuit of
                    excellence, and unwavering commitment to advancing the
                    frontiers of air launch have left an indelible mark on the

                  <p>
                    [...] Virgin Orbit was founded in 2017 by Branson, a British
                    billionaire, in hopes of targeting the market for launching
                    small satellites into space. Its LauncherOne rockets were
                    launched from the air from modified Virgin passenger planes,
                    allowing the company to operate more flexibly than using
                    fixed launch sites.

                    the economic losses incurred when weather, climate and water
                    extremes hit have soared.

                  <p>
                    [...] Developed nations accounted for over 60 percent of
                    losses due to weather, climate and water disasters, but in
                    more than four-fifths of cases, the economic losses were
                    equivalent to less than 0.1 percent of gross domestic

                    By comparison, in seven percent of the disasters to hit the
                    world's least developed countries, losses equivalent to more
                    than five percent of their GDP were reported, with several

                    that AI represents an "existential risk" that could get many
                    people "harmed or killed." He doesn't feel that threat is
                    serious at the moment, but he sees a near future where AI
                    could help find software security flaws or new biology
                    types. It's important to ensure these systems aren't
                    "misused by evil people," the veteran executive says.

                    Schmidt doesn't have a firm solution for regulating AI, but
                    he believes there won't be an AI-specific regulator in the
                    US. He participated in a National Security Commission on AI
                    that reviewed the technology and published a 2021 report
                    determining that the US wasn't ready for the tech's impact.

                  <p>
                    Schmidt doesn't have direct influence over AI. However, he
                    joins a growing number of well-known moguls who have argued
                    for a careful approach. Current Google CEO Sundar Pichai has
                    cautioned that society needs to adapt to AI, while OpenAI
                    leader Sam Altman has expressed concern that authoritarians
                    might abuse these algorithms. In March, numerous industry
                    leaders and researchers (including Elon Musk and Steve
                    Wozniak) signed an open letter calling on companies to pause

                    [...] The idea of launching far from shore could resolve
                    some environmental concerns on land, but it's not yet clear
                    whether rocket launches at sea could also cause damage to
                    marine life, or if offshore platforms are resilient enough
                    to launch megarockets the likes of Starship. As for smaller
                    rockets, that seems more feasible, as these recent tests
                    suggest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Future tests will have to determine if bigger rockets,
                    especially those capable of reaching orbit, can launch from
                    The Spaceport Company's facilities. Importantly, the company
                    recently announced a partnership with Vaya Space to launch
                    small rockets from its sea-based platforms staring in 2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a concept, launching rockets from mobile sea platforms is
                    nothing new. In 2019, China became the third country after
                    the U.S. and Russia to do so.

                    Why do I teach idealistic young people how to lead a life of
                    cybercrime? Many of my students will pursue careers in
                    government or with law firms whose clients include major
                    technology companies. I want these budding lawyers to
                    understand their clients' issues. But my larger aim is to
                    put technical expertise in its place: I want my students to
                    realize that technology alone is not enough to solve the
                    problems we face.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I start my class by explaining the fundamental principle of
                    modern computing: the distinction between code and data.
                    Code is a set of instructions: "add," "print my résumé,"
                    "shut the door." Data is information. Data is usually
                    represented by numbers (the temperature is 80 degrees), code
                    by words ("add"). But in 1936, the British mathematician
                    Alan Turing figured out that code could be represented by
                    numbers as well. Indeed, Turing was able to show how to
                    represent both code and data using only ones and zeros —
                    so-called binary strings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This groundbreaking insight makes modern computers possible.
                    We don't need to rebuild our computers for every new
                    program. We can feed our devices whatever code we like as
                    binary strings and run that program. That zeros and ones can
                    represent both code and data is, however, a blessing and a
                    curse, because it enables hackers to trick computers that
                    are expecting data into accepting and running malicious code
                    instead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Diversion programs in Britain and the Netherlands run
                    hacking competitions where teams of coders compete to hack a
                    target network; these programs also seek to match up coders
                    with older security personnel to act as mentors and direct
                    their charges into the legitimate cybersecurity industry. At
                    the moment, with an estimated 3.5 million jobs unfilled
                    worldwide, one fewer attacker is one more desperately needed
                    defender.

                    is a flexible system with use cases ranging from retro
                    gaming platforms to industrial use cases for factories and
                    more. Today we're sharing one research team's foray into
                    science with the help of our favorite SBC and looking at how
                    well it compares to modern, more expensive tools. Liam
                    Taylor, Duncan Quincy, and Mark Smith recently deployed a
                    set of Raspberry Pis to help monitor glacier calving in both
                    <a href="https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/23/329/2023"
                      >Iceland and Peru</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the team, monitoring calving fronts is critical
                    as extreme changes can result in environmental impacts for
                    local residents. For example, things like tsunamis, floods,
                    and the collapse of icebergs can cause serious damage, and
                    monitoring these changes can help those living nearby
                    respond before the problems worsen. Part of their research
                    was to test the performance of a Raspberry Pi in monitoring
                    these changes against more conventional tools they usually
                    use, in this case, an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To test the Pi against the UAV monitoring system, the team
                    traveled to Fjallsjökull, Iceland. Here they could survey
                    glaciers both from the shore and from a boat. The area also
                    had a great variety of calving margin heights that made it
                    easier to test the accuracy of the Raspberry Pi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Raspberry Pis were tested using both a Camera Module V2
                    and an HQ Camera Module using a 16mm telephoto lens. The
                    Camera Module V2 proved too inadequate for their
                    measurements, so the team opted to stick with the HQ Camera
                    Module. The UAV chosen to compare against the Pi was a DJI
                    Mavic 2 Pro UAV. The Raspberry Pis were then attached to a
                    tripod with critical components like batteries stored inside
                    a weatherproofed box.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team mounted some of the Pis to a boat as they passed by
                    while the UAV moved overhead. Recording the glaciers
                    simultaneously allowed the team to get an accurate
                    comparison of the charting ability of both devices. Using
                    the pictures taken by the Pi, the team created a 3D render
                    of the glaciers using photogrammetry.

                    A molecule that was initially developed to treat
                    tuberculosis but failed to progress out of the lab as an
                    antibiotic is now showing promise as a powerful foe for
                    weeds that invade our gardens and cost farmers billions of
                    dollars each year.

                    While the failed antibiotic wasn't fit for its original
                    purpose, scientists at the University of Adelaide discovered
                    that by tweaking its structure, the molecule became
                    effective at killing two of the most problematic weeds in
                    Australia, annual ryegrass and wild radish, without harming
                    bacterial and human cells. This research has been published

                    Researchers at the University's Herbicide and Antibiotic
                    Innovation Lab discovered there were similarities between
                    bacterial superbugs and weeds at a molecular level.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They exploited these similarities, and by chemically
                    modifying the structure of a failed antibiotic, they were
                    able to block the production of amino acid lysine, which is
                    essential for weed growth.

                    "There are no commercially available herbicides on the
                    market that work in this way. In fact, in the past 40 years,
                    there have been hardly any new herbicides with new
                    mechanisms of action that have entered the market," said Dr.
                    Andrew Barrow, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Soares da
                    Costa's team at the University of Adelaide's Waite Research

                    [...] It's not just farmers who could reap the benefits of
                    this discovery. Researchers say it could also lead to the
                    development of new weed killers to target pesky weeds
                    growing in our backyards and driveways.

                    "Our re-purposing approach has the potential to discover
                    herbicides with broad applications that can kill a variety
                    of weeds," said Dr. Barrow.

                    When working memristor technology was first announced, it
                    generated a lot of excitement within the tech industry. This
                    was mainly because memristors promised faster, more
                    energy-efficient, and longer-lasting storage solutions than
                    traditional RAM and SSDs. This led to high expectations and
                    a flurry of investments in research and development.
                    However, the hype surrounding memristors has significantly
                    waned in recent years, with the technology yet to impact the
                    market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite their potential advantages, several challenges have
                    hindered the widespread adoption of memristor technology.
                    Manufacturing memristors at a large scale has proven
                    difficult and expensive. This has limited the number of
                    companies willing to invest in developing and producing
                    memristor-based devices. Also, while memristors have shown
                    promise in laboratory settings, their real-world application
                    performance has not always met expectations. Factors such as
                    temperature fluctuations and material inconsistencies have
                    led to variable performance and stability issues. To quote
                    Wikipedia "Experimentally, the ideal memristor has yet to be
                    demonstrated." So those diligently working on the problem
                    are looking for a tantalizingly close breakthrough.

                    account tweeted "Love is sharing a password." And at CES in

                    Streaming companies have been tweaking their businesses over
                    the past year as they struggle with increasing competition
                    and the reality that people can only afford so many monthly
                    subscription fees. Many have raised prices, including Prime
                    Video, Netflix and Apple TV Plus, but no other company has
                    gone after account sharing in the same way.

                    Extreme weather caused by climate change has damaged food
                    production across Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Confronted with a deteriorating situation, divided European
                    Union decision-makers are debating new rules for genetically
                    modified crops.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last year's drought ravaged the continent's farms, starving
                    everything from Spanish olive harvests to Hungary's maize
                    and sunflower crops, Italian and Romanian corn fields to
                    France's dairy production.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some argue the answer to Europe's problems is deregulating
                    gene modification techniques to produce better crops. Others
                    claim this would be a "smokescreen" to avoid having to
                    radically change the way the bloc farms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Supporters say seeds produced using gene editing techniques
                    are less vulnerable to drought and disease—and require less
                    water.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The powerful European farming lobby group Copa-Cogeca
                    supports the new rules.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If we need to supply society with food in Europe, and if we
                    want to be self-sufficient, then we need to adapt rules,"
                    said Thor Gunnar Kofoed, chair of the seed working group at
                    Copa-Cogeca.
                  </p>
                  <p>A majority of EU lawmakers support relaxing the rules.</p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Greens want a full risk assessment to avoid
                    unintended effects and force producers to ensure detection
                    and traceability methods, and make labeling compulsory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Labeling would put off consumers who prefer GMO-free food,
                    said Mute Schimpf, a campaigner for Friends of the Earth
                    Europe, who criticized the reform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This proposal is a smokescreen to avoid the debate we
                    should have on shifting to a truly sustainable farming
                    system," she told AFP.

                    Facebook parent company Meta received a record-breaking $1.3
                    billion fine in Europe (€1.2 billion) following a privacy
                    violation that regulators have been investigating for a
                    decade. It involves the transfer of Facebook data belonging
                    to European Union users to the US. The EU started looking
                    into the company's data transfer practices in 2013,
                    following the Edward Snowden revelations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The EU action comes just months ahead of a new planned data
                    transfer deal between the US and the EU. Unsurprisingly,
                    Meta is contesting the fine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The EU worries that the Facebook data transfers in
                    question expose its citizens to privacy violations and
                    violate GDPR. The data transfers were protected by a US-EU
                    pact called the Privacy Shield. But the EU's top courts
                    found that the pact did not actually shield EU citizens. US
                    surveillance programs could still collect data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the new ruling, Meta also has to stop
                    transferring EU data to the US.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Schrems also said he expects Meta to appeal the
                    decision but that a win for the company in the case is
                    unlikely. "Past violations cannot be overcome by a new EU-US
                    deal. Meta can at best delay the payment of the fine for a
                    bit."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meta, of course, is in a position where it can afford to pay
                    such hefty privacy fines. "A billion-euro parking ticket is
                    of no consequence to a company that earns many more billions
                    by parking illegally," Johnny Ryan told The Guardian. Ryan
                    is a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Fine and restrictions aside, Meta will soon be able to
                    transfer user data to the US without having to worry about
                    fines like this. The EU and the US are working on a new deal
                    to cover such data transfers. That deal could be in place by
                    October. Still, the new agreement can't protect the company
                    from past offenses.

                    heartbreaking post detailed what had just happened — she
                    offered a $500 reward for the return of the R6.

                    After some people had falsely claimed they had her camera,

                    definitely blacked out for a second. I couldn't believe it."

                    The kind-hearted couple drove two hours to return the camera
                    and did not want the reward money, but Lee insisted that
                    they were compensated plus gas money.

                OK, it is not a 'techie' or a STEM story - but how many of us
                have lost something absolutely vital to our work? A laptop
                maybe, or probably a cell/mobile phone with all the data that it
                contains. What measures do you take now to prevent a similar
                loss in the future?

                    Two days later, the Taiwan-based hardware maker has finally
                    answered the calls for help. The mass outage, the company

                    needed to only reboot their devices. In the event that
                    didn't fix the problem, the company's support team advised
                    users to save their current configuration settings and

                    routers," one person
                    <a
                      href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/13kzm8n/comment/jkrrhh4/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3"
                      >wrote</a
                    >. "As routers automatically updated and fetched the
                    corrupted definition file, they started running out of
                    filesystem space and memory and crashing."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The explanation answered the question of what was causing
                    routers to crash, but it raised a new one: Why were routers
                    affected even when they had been configured to not
                    automatically update and no manual update had been
                    performed? Asus has yet to address this, but the likely
                    answer is that the definitions file for ASD, which resides
                    in memory and scans devices for security threats, gets
                    updated whether or not automatic updates are enabled.

                    Samsung, Oppo and Nokia are among a range of Android phone
                    makers with facial recognition scanning tech that can be
                    "easily duped" by a printed 2D photo, according to tests
                    undertaken by campaign group Which?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Resident techies that put a range of phones and brands
                    through their paces (see box below) said the findings were
                    of concern as biometric tech is often billed as one of the
                    most secure ways to unlock a handset.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of the 48 phones Which? sent to labs for testing, 19 could
                    be spoofed with photos and "worryingly" these were "not even
                    particularly high resolution and were printed on a standard
                    office printer on normal, rather than photo, paper."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The vast majority of the phones that failed the simple
                    biometric test were, unsurprisingly, low to mid-range in
                    price, though Which? claimed there were exceptions,
                    including the Xiaomi 13 and the Motorola Razr.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of the phones that Which? reckons could be fooled, seven
                    were made by Xiaomi, four came from Motorola, while two came
                    from each of Nokia, Oppo and Samsung. One model made by
                    Honor and another by Vivo was also found to be exploitable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under Android's requirements, phone makers must ensure
                    devices and software are "Android compatible," which
                    includes how often device security can be spoofed. Class 3
                    systems must not be duped more than 7 percent of the time,
                    and Class 1 system are least secure, with a spot rate of 20
                    percent of the time to more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Which? voiced worries that scammers could exploit the
                    weakness to – for example – access Google Wallet to make
                    payments to a limited value (£45 in the UK, about $56)
                    without needing to unlock their phone. For larger
                    transactions, Google asks users to use a Class 3 biometric
                    lock, Which? said.

                    Should it succeed, PLD Space will become the first private
                    micro launcher to launch a rocket in Europe's emerging space
                    race.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Spanish manufacturer PLD Space successfully carried out the
                    final ignition test of its reusable Miura 1 rocket on
                    Wednesday, setting the stage for its imminent launch from
                    southern Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the next few days, PLD Space aims to become the first
                    private micro launcher company to actually launch a rocket
                    in the European space race. The Miura 1 is a one-stage
                    suborbital rocket that stands 41 feet (12.5 meters) long, or
                    about the height of four-story building. The rocket serves
                    as a proof-of-concept for PLD's larger Miura 5 rocket, which
                    aims to launch satellites into orbit beginning in 2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    PLD Space developed the Miura 1's TEPREL-B motor in-house,
                    which can achieve a thrust of 30 kN with a simple
                    pressure-fed cycle using jet fuel. The rocket can reach an
                    altitude of 93 miles (150 kilometers) with a cargo of 220
                    pounds (100 kilograms) and is meant to be reusable for at
                    least three trips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Miura 1 will be launched towards the Atlantic
                    Ocean from a cliff on the coast of Huelva in southwestern
                    Spain, specifically a military test zone known as "Médano
                    del Loro." The launch is scheduled to take place on a
                    Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, when the area will be free of
                    fishermen, at 7:30 a.m. local time. On the day of the
                    launch, the air space will be closed, and officials will
                    establish an exclusion area in the ocean. The Spanish
                    Institute of Aerospace Technology has already approved
                    several launch windows through May 31.

                    Congress wants to force AM into every new car for emergency
                    alerts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fight over the future of AM radio got a little more
                    heated this week as organizations representing the auto and
                    technology industries told Congress that its plan to mandate
                    this mode of radio wave reception is poorly conceived and
                    will hinder progress.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AM radio has seen almost every other in-car entertainment
                    option come and go—vinyl, 8-tracks, cassettes, CDs—and it
                    might predate just about everything other than playing "I
                    Spy," but time is catching up with this old broadcast
                    technology. It is starting to get left behind as new
                    models—many of which are electric vehicles—drive off into
                    the sunset, streaming their audio instead of modulating its
                    amplitude.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "As more and more Americans adopt electric vehicles,
                    we must ensure that they are equipped with AM radio. AM
                    radio is—and will remain—an essential communications channel
                    for emergency alerts and for disseminating news and other
                    important information to residents of our district and
                    communities across our country. I am proud to co-lead this
                    bipartisan legislation which would ensure that EVs continue
                    to be equipped with this basic but critical capability,"
                    said Rep. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), another co-sponsor.

                    Shutterstock is buying Giphy for $53 million after Meta's
                    acquisition of the popular GIF platform was blocked by the

                    That price represents a steep discount compared to what Meta
                    (then Facebook) reportedly agreed to pay for Giphy

                    >
                    the deal was worth around $400 million, while

                    >
                    closer to $315 million. Either way, a $53 million price tag
                    is a bargain versus Giphy's peak valuation of around $600
                    million in 2016. As part of the deal, Meta will retain
                    access to Giphy's library across its products.

                  <p>
                    Meta's acquisition of Giphy ran into trouble when the UK's
                    competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority
                    (CMA), ordered Facebook's parent company to
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22740272/facebook-giphy-acquisition-competition-and-markets-authority-uk-regulator"
                      >unwind the deal in 2021</a
                    >. The CMA argued that the deal could harm competition by
                    increasing Meta's market power, potentially allowing it to
                    block its rival's access to GIFs or force them to hand over
                    valuable user data in exchange for them. Although it
                    appealed the ruling,
                    <a

                  <p>
                    For Shutterstock, the deal will augment its content library,
                    expanding it to include GIFs and Stickers. The company also
                    said it would help its "generative AI and metadata
                    strategy." That's a bit more vague, but Shutterstock is
                    currently using

                      >generative AI to provide imagery to its customers</a
                    >. Acquiring Giphy's substantial library could theoretically
                    give Shutterstock reams of training data for future AI-based
                    products.

                    "Through the Giphy acquisition, we are extending our
                    audience touch points beyond primarily professional
                    marketing and advertising use cases and expanding into
                    casual conversations," Shutterstock CEO Paul Hennessy said
                    in a statement. "We plan to leverage Shutterstock's unique
                    capabilities in content and metadata monetization,
                    generative AI, studio production and creative automation to
                    enable the commercialization of our GIF library as we roll
                    this offering out to customers."

                    All modern Intel and AMD PCs can trace their roots to a
                    single system: the IBM Personal Computer. Originally
                    released in August 1981, this computer became so popular and
                    long-lived that competitors reverse-engineered its BIOS so
                    that their computers could use the same software and
                    peripherals, a practice that eventually resulted in a de
                    facto standard whose descendants we still use today.

                    If you want to experience what using an old IBM PC was like,
                    you could drop a few hundred dollars on a used one on eBay.

                    5/20/2023: After this story was published, Ars was contacted
                    by developer Sergey Kiselev, who maintains an open-source
                    8088 BIOS on GitHub. He alleged that the creators of the
                    Book 8088 re-used his BIOS for the system while removing his
                    name and language about the GPL v2 license that the BIOS is
                    distributed under; we can't confirm the claim by comparing
                    the code directly, but there are several distinct
                    similarities in a screenshot Kiselev shared and one used in
                    the Book 8088 retail listing.

                    "While my work is open source, and I don't mind people using
                    it in their projects, I do care deeply about the principles
                    of open source software development and licensing. And
                    whoever manufacturers this machine, bluntly violates
                    copyright law and licensing," wrote Kiselev to Ars detailing
                    his claim. "Since you start your article with the discussion
                    of how Compaq reverse engineered IBM's BIOS, I think it
                    would be suitable to mention that the manufacturer pirated
                    the BIOS, without crediting the work, and they violate GPL
                    by not releasing the source code of their modified BIOS."

                According to Raspberry Pi CEO, Eben Upton, in an interview with
                YouTuber Jeff Geerling, the company put together 750,000
                Raspberry Pi units in the first quarter of the year. That isn't
                a lot, but it also says that it's on track for building 2
                million units this second quarter, helping it fill backlogged
                orders and paving the way for "unconstrained" supply during the
                remaining half of the year. Ultimately though, it means that you
                should expect units such as the Raspberry Pi 4 to be more widely
                available by the end of this year.

                    never printed the text "AI Injection succeeded." It also
                    worked about 20 percent of the times I tried.

                  <p>
                    I then edited some Tom's Hardware YouTube videos'
                    transcripts to add prompts to them. I learned that you do
                    not necessarily need to put the prefix "***IMPORTANT NEW
                    INSTRUCTIONS***" to get this to work, though adding
                    "Instruction:" may help. I also experimented with putting
                    the prompts at the top or in the middle of a transcript
                    instead of at the bottom. Overall, it seems that top or
                    bottom placement could work but, either way, the prompt
                    instructions would only be followed at the end of the
                    summarization.

                  <p>
                    The only injected prompts I was able to get working were
                    telling a joke and Rickrolling. When I tried inserting
                    prompts that would command ChatGPT to print specific text,
                    use emojis or just ignore the summarization entirely, it
                    didn't work. Even asking for a specific type of joke didn't
                    work.

                    "The UK has strengths across the semiconductor value chain,
                    but possesses three particular areas of strategic advantage
                    — semiconductor design and IP, compound semiconductors, and
                    our world-leading research and innovation system, supported
                    by our fantastic universities," the policy paper said.
                    Unlike silicon-based chips, compound semiconductors are
                    composed of two or more elements, and can be used to
                    optimize high-performance applications in electronics and
                    optoelectronics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The policy paper also noted that there are currently around
                    25 semiconductor manufacturing sites in the UK that process
                    between a few hundred wafers to several thousand wafers per
                    month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Though the UK government appears to have recognized
                    the potential of building on its existing research base to
                    develop its semiconductor sector, there needs to be further
                    clarity around exactly what the £1 billion will be applied
                    to, as well as how and when it will be applied, said Scott
                    White, founder and executive director of strategic
                    initiatives at UK-based Pragmatic Semiconductor, a maker of
                    custom integrated circuits that provide an alternative to
                    silicon-based chips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "When you look at the areas the UK is focused on there is a
                    valid question to be asked over whether that's enough money
                    to make a difference – is it too much of a dilution to
                    spread the amount over 10 years," he said, adding that the
                    government needs to provide more detail in order to address
                    these concerns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Ultimately, you could invest £100 million annually into
                    something that really moves the needle for the industry. You
                    could equally waste £1 billion in a year by focusing it on
                    areas that won't have an impact," White said.

                    The origin of the world's most popular beer may have
                    inadvertently come about due to the death of a childless
                    German nobleman, Professor John Morrissey, School of
                    Microbiology, UCC and an international team of researchers
                    have discovered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Combining historical research with modern science, a team of
                    scientists from the Technical University of Munich in
                    Germany and UCC have uncovered the likely genesis and path
                    to world dominance of <em>Saccharomyces pastorianus</em> –
                    the yeast responsible for producing lager yeast. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lager yeast is a distinct bottom-fermenting species that
                    prefers cooler temperatures and sediments stronger compared
                    to the top-fermenting ale yeast. The famous Bavarian
                    Reinheitsgebot brewing ordnance of 1516 stipulated that only
                    bottom fermentation was permitted – but in 1548 the powerful
                    nobleman Hans VI von Degenberg was granted a dispensation to
                    allow the brewing wheat beer through top fermentation.
                    However when Hans VIII Sigmund von Degenberg, the grandson
                    of Hans VI, died without an heir in 1602, his property and
                    assets- including the family brewery at Schwarzach in
                    Bavaria - were seized by Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria and
                    later Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Historical records show that on Oct 24th 1602,
                    top-fermenting yeast were brought from Schwarzach to the
                    Duke's Hofbräuhaus brewery in Munich, where the brewing of
                    wheat beer then alternated with the traditional Bavarian
                    brown beer. Now, writing in the peer-reviewed Journal FEMS
                    Yeast Research, the authors propose that by the time a
                    dedicated wheat beer brewery had opened in 1607,
                    top-fermenting wheat beer yeasts from Schwarzach and
                    bottom-fermenting yeasts from the Munich Hofbräühaus had
                    mated to create a brand new species that we now know as
                    <em>S. pastorianus</em> – the lager yeast. And, as they say
                    – the rest is history.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We often think historical events are almost pre-programmed,
                    but this is an amazing example of how chance events – the
                    lack of an heir, the Duke's thirst for wheat beer, and the
                    unorthodox sex between different yeasts, culminated in a new
                    yeast species that changed the world of beer," Professor
                    Morrissey said.
