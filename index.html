                    Coral reefs, the deep sea or the treetops of the rainforests
                    are considered the main hotspots of biodiversity. However,
                    they all trail behind the soils. According to a new study,
                    soils are the most species-rich ecosystems worldwide. Their
                    importance for human nutrition is enormous, and the
                    proportion of soils worldwide that are considered degraded
                    or destroyed is growing steadily. A trio of researchers led
                    by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and
                    Landscape Research WSL has now made the first estimate of
                    global soil biodiversity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Since the data on soil diversity is extremely
                    patchy—especially in the global South—the results of the
                    study show huge ranges in some cases. For bacteria, for
                    example, the mean value is 40% of species living in the
                    soil—but the range extends from 25% to 88%. The
                    uncertainties are also enormous for viruses, which are
                    mainly studied as human pathogens. Accordingly, the authors
                    are bracing themselves for some criticism of their methods
                    and conclusions. "Our work is a first but important attempt
                    to estimate what proportion of global biodiversity lives in
                    the soil," says Anthony.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The goal, he says, is to provide the basis for much-needed
                    decisions to protect soils and their creatures worldwide.
                    "Soils are under enormous pressure, whether from
                    agricultural intensification, climate change, invasive
                    species and much more," Anthony points out. "Our study shows
                    that the diversity in soils is great and correspondingly
                    important, so they should be given much more consideration
                    in conservation."

                    California regulators gave approval Thursday to two rival
                    robotaxi companies, Cruise and Waymo, to operate their
                    driverless cars 24/7 across all of San Francisco and charge
                    passengers for their services.

                  <p>
                    The much-anticipated vote, which followed roughly six hours
                    of public comment both for and against driverless taxis,
                    came amid clashes between the robotaxi companies and some
                    residents of the hilly city. San Francisco first responders,
                    city transportation leaders and local activists are among
                    those who shared concerns about the technology.

                    The California Public Utilities Commission regulates
                    self-driving cars in the state and voted 3-to-1 in favor of
                    Waymo and Cruise expanding their operations.

                    [...] Genevieve Shiroma, the dissenting commissioner in the
                    3-1 vote, recommended the commission delay the vote until
                    they received a "better understanding of the safety impacts"
                    of the vehicles.

                    A few weeks ago when Twitter was renamed to X, and we
                    learned that Elon Musk somehow thinks people are going to
                    use "x" as both a verb and noun, I recalled having once
                    stumbled upon this 1983 "On Language" column from the late
                    great William Safire:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        "The Federal bureaucracy has invented a new verb," says
                        Charles DeLaFuente of Kew Gardens, N.Y., who had just
                        sent in his 1040 income-tax return to the Internal
                        Revenue Service. He attached an addressed envelope that
                        he had received from the I.R.S.; in the upper left-hand
                        corner, where the return address of the taxpayer
                        belongs, is the heavy black outline of a box. Next to
                        the box are the words "X box if refund."
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        "Never mind the unanswered question, 'If refund what?',"
                        the irate taxpayer observed. "We all know they mean to x
                        the box if you have a refund coming. Maybe the ink they
                        saved on those instructions will pay for the next round
                        of tax cuts."
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Mr. DeLaFuente — his name means "of the fountain" — is
                        blowing his geyser for the wrong reason. The verb to x
                        is not new. In 1849, Edgar Allan Poe wrote in one of his
                        tales: "'I shell have to x this ere paragrab,' said he
                        to himself, as he read it over." In 1935, Jonas Bayer
                        carried that crossing-out metaphor into the mechanical
                        age in Startling Detective magazine: "An imported
                        hatchet man with a .45-caliber typewriter can x out the
                        dangerous canary." Merriam-Webster's first citation in
                        the one-letter verb's literal sense is from Henry

                    One of them involves games trying to make use of Intel's

                    Intel's ARC series GPUs are interesting, in many senses of
                    the word. They offer the best implementation of Intel's
                    image reconstruction system, XeSS, similar to Nvidia's DLSS
                    and AMD's FSR. XeSS, like its counterparts, utilizes machine
                    learning to fill in the pixel gaps on anti-aliased objects
                    and scenes. The results are sometimes clear, sometimes a bit
                    fuzzy if you pay close attention. In our review of Intel's
                    A770 and A750 GPUs in late 2022, we noted that
                    cross-compatibility between all three systems could be in
                    the works.

                    That kind of easy-swap function is not the case when a game
                    is running on a customized version of the WINE
                    Windows-on-Linux, translating Direct3D graphics calls to
                    Vulkan and prodding to see whether it, too, can make use of
                    Intel's graphics boost. As noted by Phoronix, Intel
                    developers contributing to the open source Mesa graphics
                    project added the ability to hide an Intel GPU from the
                    Vulkan Linux driver.

                    Currently, Maya is being installed only in Defence Ministry
                    systems and not on computers connected to the networks of
                    the three Services. On this, the official said the three
                    Services had also vetted it and would adopt it on service
                    networks as well soon. The Navy had already cleared it and
                    the Army and the Air Force were currently evaluating it, the
                    official added.

                    Maya was developed by government development agencies within
                    six months, the official said. Maya would prevent malware
                    attacks and other cyberattacks which had seen a steep
                    increase, the official noted.

              <p>
                However, the attacks in and of themselves are less of a problem
                than the fact that a large, and increasing, number of them are
                successful against that aging legacy desktop operating system.

                For India to pull this off successfully, they must study how
                their opponent has maneuvered over the years against GNU/Linux
                deployments and in particular look at case studies like Kerala,
                Munich, Lower Saxony, Vaasa, and Turku. India's opponent in this
                move has had many programmes, years ago one was
                <a href="http://techrights.org/wiki/index.php/EDGI">EDGI</a>,
                and a long standing mandate that "under NO circumstances lose
                against Linux".

                    Amazon ships more than a million packages daily, but there's
                    at least one person in a million who frowns when she
                    encounters a smiling box placed on her doorstep.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A Canadian woman, Anca Nitu, told CBC that over the past two
                    months, more than 50 packages have arrived at her home. Each
                    package contained a return slip and a pair of shoes from an
                    Amazon buyer located in North America who wrongly shipped
                    their rejected shoes to Nitu's address.<br />[...]<br />Amazon
                    said that typically the company advises any recipient of an
                    unwanted package to fill out a
                    <a
                      href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G33XVXQPUV79Z2ZC"
                      >Report Unwanted Package</a
                    >
                    form. That Amazon page says to report any unsolicited
                    packages "immediately," confirming that "third-party sellers
                    are prohibited from sending unsolicited packages to
                    customers."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Nitu, her worries won't necessarily end, even if the
                    packages ever do stop coming. She told CBC that she has no
                    idea whether the Amazon sellers that are using her
                    information to ship unwanted return items are doing anything
                    else with her information. She also worries that if Amazon
                    doesn't unlink her name from the seller accounts, she could
                    one day be charged Amazon seller fees.

                Fermilab's g-2 experiment has released a new round of data.
                Physicists now have a brand-new measurement of a property of the
                muon called the anomalous magnetic moment that improves the
                precision of their previous result by a factor of 2. The result
                is in tension with Standard Model predictions.
              </p>
              <p>
                An international collaboration of scientists working on the Muon
                g-2 experiment at the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermi National
                Accelerator Laboratory announced the much-anticipated updated
                measurement on Aug. 10. This new value bolsters the first result
                they announced in April 2021 and sets up a showdown between
                theory and experiment over 20 years in the making.
              </p>
              <p>
                "We're really probing new territory. We're determining the muon
                magnetic moment at a better precision than it has ever been seen
                before," said Brendan Casey, a senior scientist at Fermilab who
                has worked on the Muon g-2 experiment since 2008.

                    "The sun is more surprising than we knew," said Mehr Un
                    Nisa, a postdoctoral research associate at Michigan State
                    University. "We thought we had this star figured out, but
                    that's not the case."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nisa, who will soon be joining [Michigan State University's]
                    faculty, is the corresponding author of a new paper in the
                    journal <i>Physical Review Letters</i> that details the
                    discovery of the highest-energy light ever observed from the
                    sun.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The international team behind the discovery also found that
                    this type of light, known as gamma rays, is surprisingly
                    bright. That is, there's more of it than scientists had
                    previously anticipated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although the high-energy light doesn't reach the Earth's
                    surface, these gamma rays create telltale signatures that
                    were detected by Nisa and her colleagues working with the
                    High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory, or HAWC.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We now have observational techniques that weren't
                    possible a few years ago," said Nisa, who works in the
                    Department of Physics and Astronomy in the College of
                    Natural Science. "In this particular energy regime, other
                    ground-based telescopes couldn't look at the sun because
                    they only work at night," she said. "Ours operates 24/7."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "After looking at six years' worth of data, out popped
                    this excess of gamma rays," Nisa said. "When we first saw
                    it, we were like, 'We definitely messed this up. The sun
                    cannot be this bright at these energies.'"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The gamma rays that Nisa and her colleagues observed
                    had about 1 trillion electron volts, or 1 tera electron
                    volt, abbreviated 1 TeV. Not only was this energy level
                    surprising, but so was the fact that they were seeing so
                    much of it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This shows that HAWC is adding to our knowledge of
                    our galaxy at the highest energies, and it's opening up
                    questions about our very own sun," Nisa said. "It's making
                    us see things in a different light. Literally."

                    Improving those speeds by a factor of between 10 and 100

                    pesky limit that is the speed of light means it won't allow

                A team of researchers from British universities has trained a

                    When Zoom was used for training the sound classification
                    algorithm, the prediction accuracy dropped to 93%, which is
                    still dangerously high, and a record for that medium.

                  <p>
                    Such an attack severely affects the target's data security,
                    as it could leak people's passwords, discussions, messages,
                    or other sensitive information to malicious third parties.

                    Moreover, contrary to other side-channel attacks that
                    require special conditions and are subject to data rate and
                    distance limitations, acoustic attacks have become much
                    simpler due to the abundance of microphone-bearing devices
                    that can achieve high-quality audio captures.

                    The basic idea of turning an asteroid into a rotating space
                    habitat has existed for a while. Despite that, it's always
                    seemed relatively far off regarding technologies, so the
                    concept hasn't received much attention over the years.<br />...
                    <br />David W. Jensen, a retired Technical Fellow at
                    Rockwell Collins ... released a 65-page paper that details
                    an easy-to-understand, relatively inexpensive, and feasible
                    plan to turn an asteroid into a space habitat. <br />...
                    <br />
                    Dr. Jensen breaks the discussion into three main categories
                    – asteroid selection, habitat style selection, and mission
                    strategy to get there (i.e., what robots to use). <br />...
                    <br />After a relatively in-depth selection process, Dr.
                    Jensen decided on one in particular as a good candidate –
                    Atira. This S-type asteroid has an entire class of asteroids
                    named after it. Atira comes in at about a 4.8 km diameter
                    and even has its own moon – a 1 km diameter asteroid that
                    orbits it closely. <br />... <br />He eventually settled on
                    a torus as the ideal habitat type and then dives into
                    calculations about the overall station mass, how to support
                    the inner wall with massive columns, and how to allocate
                    floor space. All important, but how exactly would we build
                    such a massive behemoth? <br />Self-replicating robots are
                    Dr. Jensen's answer. The report's third section details a
                    plan to utilize spider robots and a base station that can
                    replicate themselves. He stresses the importance of only
                    sending the most advanced technical components from Earth
                    and using materials on the asteroid itself to build
                    everything else, from rock grinders to solar panels.

                    recent voyage of NASA's intrepid Ingenuity helicopter on

                    US scientists responsible for a historic nuclear fusion
                    breakthrough say they have repeated the feat—this time
                    achieving a greater yield of energy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory stunned the world
                    in December when it announced it had carried out an
                    experimental nuclear reaction that put out more energy than
                    was put into it, a holy grail of science in the quest for
                    unlimited, clean power to end the era of fossil fuels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We can confirm the experiment produced a higher yield than
                    the December 2022 experiment," public information officer
                    Paul Rhien said Monday in an emailed statement, without
                    disclosing specific figures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He added the California lab planned to report the results at
                    upcoming scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed
                    publications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Nuclear fusion has been touted by its supporters as a
                    clean, abundant and safe source of energy that could
                    eventually allow humanity to break its dependence on coal,
                    crude oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbons driving a
                    global climate crisis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, there is still a long way to go before fusion is
                    viable on an industrial scale, providing power to homes and
                    businesses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] During December's experiment, the lab used 192
                    ultra-powerful lasers to deliver 2.05 megajoules of energy
                    to a tiny capsule smaller than a pea containing isotopes of
                    hydrogen. It produced 3.15 megajoules of fusion energy
                    output.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the result was a net energy gain, 300 megajoules of
                    energy was needed from the electrical grid to power the
                    lasers.

                    [...] Ensuring that's all correctly set up adds extra time
                    and complexity, making for a much more time-consuming
                    experience than pulling into a gas station and simply
                    filling up the tank.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite a downward trend in recent months, EVs still remain,
                    on average, more expensive to buy than gas cars, and that's
                    a big issue for buyers on a tighter budget. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Another key factor for buyers to consider when
                    purchasing a car is how long they expect it to last. Modern
                    cars now last longer on average than ever before, largely
                    due to improvements in materials and the manufacturing
                    process over time. However, EVs also feature an extra
                    variable that, for now, remains largely unknown: how much
                    the battery will degrade over the years it's on the
                    road. Most of the current data we have to examine
                    degradation comes from Tesla, and it seems promising –- on
                    average, the brand claimed its battery lost only 12% of its
                    capacity over 200,000 miles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, data from other manufacturers is extremely limited
                    or non-existent. A study by UK-based
                    <a
                      href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/technology/battery-life-uncertainty-prompts-concern-over-used-evs"
                      >Autocar</a
                    >
                    claimed certain models could reach problematic levels of
                    degradation in less than a decade, with batteries degrading
                    more rapidly once they lose 30% capacity. This, in turn,
                    could make older EVs effectively unsellable, especially
                    those with lower ranges from the factory to begin with. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] With extreme temperatures becoming more common in the
                    face of climate change, another flaw EVs face is that they
                    generally don't cope very well with colder climates. In
                    fact,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.slashgear.com/837516/this-is-how-temperature-can-affect-ev-range/"
                      >temperature can affect range significantly</a
                    >, with the average range dropping by 41% at 20°F compared
                    to 77°F, according to the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/fuel-economy-cold-weather"
                      >Department of Energy</a
                    >. In comparison, a gas car only loses 15% of its range on
                    average. A 41% drop in range is a deal breaker for many
                    people, especially in places where such temperatures are
                    expected throughout significant parts of the winter months.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Not only that, but a study by the
                    <a href="https://inl.gov/article/electric-vehicles/"
                      >Idaho National Laboratory</a
                    >
                    found that charging times were much slower in cold weather
                    too. A 30-minute charge with a DCFC fast charger saw
                    researchers achieve an 80% charge at 77°F, but at 32°F, they
                    only recorded 44% charge. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There's no obvious solution to these issues for now, but EV
                    manufacturers will have to address them in the immediate
                    future if they have any hope of convincing northern buyers
                    that it's worth the switch to electric.

                Paraphrasing an auto technician training site (can't find
                reference now):<br />Mechanical problems are easy/fast to
                diagnose (they can be seen), but time-consuming / hard to
                fix.<br />Electrical/electronic problems are hard/slow to
                diagnose, but fast/easy to fix.

              <p>
                What are the chances that the car companies will give more than
                lip service to the questions of service/diagnosis for all this
                electronics?

                    Planets that go rogue orbit no star. They wander the vacuum
                    of space alone, having been kicked out of their star systems
                    by gravitational interactions with other planets and stars.
                    Nobody really knows how many rogue planets could be out
                    there, but that may change in a few years.

                    Processor companies typically iterate off proven designs,
                    and for good reason. Changing too many things at once
                    introduces a lot of risk. A lot of changing parts makes it
                    hard to get a good picture of overall performance, so it
                    also makes tuning difficult. Pentium 4 and Bulldozer made
                    clean breaks from prior architectures, and both were
                    unsuccessful designs. But sometimes, making a clean break
                    does pay off.

                    Sandy Bridge is one such case. It inherited architectural
                    features from Intel's prior P6 and Netburst architectures,
                    but can't be considered a member of either line. Unlike
                    Netburst, Sandy Bridge was so successful that Intel's high
                    performance cores to this day can trace their lineage to
                    back to it. In the early 2010s, Sandy Bridge was so
                    successful that Intel went completely unchallenged in the
                    high end CPU market. And as a testament to the
                    architecture's solid design, Sandy Bridge CPUs still deliver
                    enough performance to remain usable across a range of
                    everyday tasks.

                        This is from Microsoft's explanation. The China
                        attackers "acquired an inactive MSA consumer signing key
                        and used it to forge authentication tokens for Azure AD
                        enterprise and MSA consumer to access OWA and
                        Outlook.com. All MSA keys active prior to the
                        incident—including the actor-acquired MSA signing
                        key—have been invalidated. Azure AD keys were not
                        impacted. Though the key was intended only for MSA
                        accounts, a validation issue allowed this key to be
                        trusted for signing Azure AD tokens. The actor was able
                        to obtain new access tokens by presenting one previously
                        issued from this API due to a design flaw. This flaw in
                        the GetAccessTokenForResourceAPI has since been fixed to
                        only accept tokens issued from Azure AD or MSA
                        respectively. The actor used these tokens to retrieve
                        mail messages from the OWA API."

                    NASA has succeeded in re-establishing full contact with
                    Voyager 2 by using its highest-power transmitter to send an
                    "interstellar shout" that righted the distant probe's
                    antenna orientation, the space agency said Friday.

                    Launched in 1977 to explore the outer planets and serve as a
                    beacon of humanity to the wider universe, it is currently
                    more than 12.3 billion miles (19.9 billion kilometers) from
                    our planet—well beyond the solar system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A series of planned commands sent to the spaceship on July
                    21 mistakenly caused the antenna to point two degrees away
                    from Earth, compromising its ability to send and receive
                    signals and endangering its mission.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The situation was not expected to be resolved until at least
                    October 15 when Voyager 2 was scheduled to carry out an
                    automated realignment maneuver.

                    But on Tuesday, engineers enlisted the help of multiple
                    Earth observatories that form the Deep Space Network (DSN)
                    to detect a carrier or "heartbeat" wave from Voyager 2,
                    though the signal was still too faint to read the data it
                    carried.

                    In a new update on Friday, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
                    (JPL), which built and operates the probe, said it had
                    succeeded in a longshot effort to send instructions that
                    righted the craft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The Deep Space Network used the highest-power transmitter
                    to send the command (the 100-kw S-band uplink from the
                    Canberra site) and timed it to be sent during the best
                    conditions during the antenna tracking pass in order to
                    maximize possible receipt of the command by the spacecraft,"
                    Voyager project manager Suzanne Dodd told AFP.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This so-called "interstellar shout" required 18.5 hours
                    traveling at light speed to reach Voyager, and it took 37
                    hours for mission controllers to learn whether the command
                    worked, JPL said in a statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The probe began returning science and telemetry data at
                    12:29 am Eastern Time on August 4, "indicating it is
                    operating normally and that it remains on its expected
                    trajectory," added JPL.

                    Most modern marine vessels are heavily equipped with
                    technology, from GPS and navigation systems to electronic
                    chart displays and information systems (ECDIS). The arrival
                    of this new technology has sailed superyachts into dangerous
                    waters with a new type of pirate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Owning a superyacht is a luxury for the world's financial
                    elite due to the exorbitant cost of buying and maintaining
                    one. High-tech superyachts with wealthy owners create the
                    perfect combination for bounty-hungry hacking pirates.
                  </p>

                    [...] Cyber security expert Naveen Hemanna explains how the
                    rise of digital banking and cryptocurrencies helps fuel this
                    form of crime. He told Euronews, "The pirates need not be on
                    the boat. It's all virtual warfare, which is happening
                    because your wealth is also not physical. It's virtual, so
                    you don't really need to have a physical presence to get
                    that money out".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cyber threats to yachts have increased since COVID, proving
                    that it's not plain sailing for yacht owners in the modern
                    world. However, the future of marine vessels is becoming
                    more sustainable and eco-friendly for the waters they are
                    sailing in.

                    When NASA says a celestial event is noteworthy, you know it
                    should be spectacular.

                  <p>
                    That's certainly the case with the Perseid meteor shower,
                    which

                    >
                    "the best meteor shower of the year," and is correspondingly
                    the "most popular meteor shower,"
                    <a
                      href="https://www.amsmeteors.org/meteor-showers/meteor-shower-calendar/#Perseids"
                      >according to the American Meteor Society</a
                    >
                    (AMS).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although the Perseid meteor shower is visible this year from
                    July 14–September 1, it is expected to peak on August 12 and
                    early on August 13. Stargazers can expect to see up to 100
                    meteors per hour traveling at 37 miles per second, NASA
                    notes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "With swift and bright meteors, Perseids frequently leave
                    long 'wakes' of light and color behind them as they streak
                    through Earth's atmosphere," NASA explains. "Perseids are
                    also known for their fireballs, which are larger explosions
                    of light and color that can persist longer than an average
                    meteor streak."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Comets, which originate far outside the orbit of the
                    outermost planets, have elliptical orbits around the Sun.
                    For perspective, since they can be miles in diameter,
                    <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/comets">NASA notes</a> that
                    they are about the "size of a small town."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Comets are essentially a giant "dirty snowball" made of
                    frozen gasses with embedded rock and dust particles, NASA
                    continues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As comets near the Sun during their orbit, they warm,
                    freeing bits of rock and dust that are then left behind in
                    what can be thought of as a trail of debris. Every year,
                    when Earth passes through these trails of rock and dust on
                    its own orbit around the Sun, the debris particles collide
                    with Earth's atmosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When this happens, the particles heat up to temperatures of
                    around 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, creating streaks across the
                    sky,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.space.com/3113-meteors-meteor-showers-science.html"
                      >Space.com explains</a
                    >. Those streaks, or shooting stars, stop abruptly when the
                    intense heat evaporates most meteors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fragments of space debris that collide with Earth's
                    atmosphere to create the Perseid meteor shower each summer
                    were left in the wake of a comet named 109P/Swift-Tuttle.
                    The comet has a unique name because it was discovered in
                    1862 independently by both Lewis Swift and Horace Tuttle,
                    NASA explains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Swift-Tuttle is a large comet with a nucleus that is 16
                    miles wide. Amazingly, it takes 133 years for it to orbit
                    the Sun.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although meteor showers are caused by comet debris colliding
                    with Earth's atmosphere, they are named for their radiant —
                    where they appear to come from in the night sky.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Perseid meteor shower gets its name because its meteors
                    appear to come from the constellation Perseus, named for the
                    famed Greek hero. Perseus not only slew Medusa the Gorgon
                    who had snakes as hair, he also rescued his future wife
                    Andromeda from a sea monster sent by Poseidon to destroy the
                    coast and land of Ethiopia.

                    In a couple of days, I pack up my bags to head for DEFCON.
                    In a rare moment of pre-planning, perhaps spurred by
                    boredom, I looked through the schedule to see what's in
                    store in the world of telephony. There is a workshop on SS7,
                    of course [1], plenty of content on cellular, but as far as
                    I see nothing on the biggest topic in telecom security:

                  <p>The Nature of Circuit Switching</p>
                  <p>
                    Understanding today's robocalling problem requires starting
                    a long time ago. Taking you all the way back to the
                    invention of the telephone would be a little gratuitous, but
                    it is useful to start our discussion with the introduction
                    of direct distance dialing in 1951. In that year, the first
                    long-distance call was completed based only on the customer
                    dialing a number. Over the following decades direct distance
                    dialing became more common and fewer telephone users had to
                    speak to an operator to have a long-distance call
                    established. Today, it's universal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Handling dial calls over long distance trunks is a bit
                    complicated, though. For local calls, handling was
                    relatively simple. The other customer was connected to the
                    same exchange that you were, so the exchange just needed to
                    be able to detect your dialing and select the correct local
                    loop corresponding to the number you dialed. Step-by-step
                    (SxS) switches have been handling this problem since the
                    turn of the 20th century. For long distance calls, though,
                    the recipient will not be on the same switch---they'll be on
                    a foreign exchange.

                When things don't work out for scooter rental companies and they
                shut down or pull out of a city, they usually take spare stock
                with them. However, when Spin backed out of Seattle, many locals
                discovered unused scooters scattered throughout the city. Upon
                closer inspection of these abandoned devices, or should we say
                dissection, it was uncovered that they each have a Raspberry Pi
                4B inside.
              </p>
              <p>
                This discovery was recently shared on social media. Legally, if
                the scooters are abandoned then snagging one for the Pi inside
                is fair game but it's not clear if Spin has plans to recover
                their remaining assets.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Seattle city government official website confirm that Spin
                originally arrived in 2021 as a fourth scooter rental option.
                However, the company did not renew its license for the most
                recent cycle. Because of this, you can find a few remaining Spin
                scooters around the city.

                    a Geographic Information System (GIS) for the lunar surface,
                    we need the same estimate for the Moon's selenoid (the

                    from 2019 granting news agencies' so-called "neighboring
                    rights." These rights were designed to reduce the "value

                    off of AFP's news content.

                    the remuneration owed to AFP under the neighboring rights

                    Developers across the world are mourning the loss of Bram
                    Moolenaar, renowned Dutch software engineer and creator of
                    the Vim text editor:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Beyond creating an industry standard for text editing
                    software, Moolenaar also pioneered an open-source and
                    community-driven approach to its development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He was the first to coin the term "charityware." Although
                    users may use and copy Vim for free, they are encouraged to
                    donate to the International Child Care Fund Holland to help
                    children in Uganda.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I have never wanted to make money from Vim," said Moolenaar
                    in an interview last year. "It started as a hobby and most
                    of the time I had a job that paid well enough."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Donations amount to around €30,000 per year — enough to help
                    about 50 children finish their education, from primary
                    school to university.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While he might have logged off from this world for
                    good, Moolenaar's legacy and Vim — a text editor that
                    continues to empower developers across the globe — lives on.

                In 1965, Popular Hot Rodding magazine bought a $250 '57 Chevy
                for a test bed, to try out various drag racing parts and tuning
                techniques. It was called Project X back then, here's a capsule

                    small-blocks, big-blocks, mechanical fuel Injection,
                    multibarrel carbs, cross-ram manifolds, superchargers, and
                    even electronic fuel injection. The Project X 1957 Chevy has
                    had it all over the decades. It was a car constantly
                    reinventing itself to keep up with the latest trends in hot
                    rodding.

                Along the way it also appeared in the movie Hollywood Knights
                and has become arguably the most famous '57 Chevy ever. Nearly
                20 years ago it want back to GM for a "makeover" including a
                modified Corvette front suspension, and since then it picked up
                another nickname, the "Million-Dollar Chevy."

                Jump to the present, they recently converted it to BEV, using a
                new GM "crate motor",

                software to deliver good power for a whole pass down the drag

                    At this point our best 60-foot time was a solid 1.54
                    seconds. We were really happy with that time but at around
                    100 feet the system was dropping the voltage and killing our
                    ET. The engineers kept working on the issue and eventually
                    the car was waking up again around the 570-foot mark, but
                    that loss in the middle was still hurting our overall time.
                    The best analogy is an EFI car with fuel-control issues, but
                    instead of running out of fuel, we were losing electricity
                    flow.

                    into Dubai's metropolitan environment and reduce energy

                    The MBR Solar Park claims many world records with its

                    The solar spire stands at about 260 metres high, which is
                    roughly 60 metres short of Paris' Eiffel Tower.

                    the sun's rays into thermal energy and store it for about 15
                    hours - able to provide electricity around the clock,
                    solving a major issue with renewable technology.

                    The installation is part of the project's fourth phase,

                    intelligence, and blockchain into the mix to coordinate the
                    new normal of powering cities.

                A team of paleontologists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
                working with colleagues from Xi'an Jiaotong University, the
                University of York, the University of Chinese Academy of
                Sciences and the National Research Center on Human Evolution,
                has found evidence of a previously unknown human lineage. In
                their study, reported in Journal of Human Evolution, the group
                analyzed the fossilized jawbone, partial skull and some leg
                bones of a hominin dated to 300,000 years ago.
              </p>
              <p>
                The fossils were excavated at a site in Hualongdong, in what is
                now a part of East China. They were subsequently subjected to
                both a morphological and a geometric assessment, with the
                initial focus on the jawbone, which exhibited unique features—a
                triangular lower edge and a unique bend.

                  <p>
                    In a world first, a quadriplegic man in the United States
                    has regained touch and movement after surgeons successfully
                    implanted microchips into his brain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AI is then used to read, interpret and translate his
                    thoughts into action.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Keith Thomas, 45, broke his neck in an accident and became
                    paralysed from his chest down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A team of medical professionals first spent months
                    mapping Thomas' brain using MRIs to help pinpoint the areas
                    responsible for both arm movement and the sensation of touch
                    in his hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>He then underwent a 15-hour open-brain surgery.</p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Dr Ashesh Mehta, the surgeon who performed Thomas'
                    brain surgery said the wiring in Thomas' brain was "broken".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "What we did was a bypass, so we bypassed the block.
                    So, we're basically using a computer to read Keith's
                    thoughts and then translate that into a machine that then
                    stimulates his hand so that he can move it," explained
                    Mehta.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The procedure - dubbed as a "double neural bypass" - goes
                    the other direction as well. He can now "feel" something
                    through tiny electrodes instead of neurons responsible for
                    feeling his fingertips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The tiny sensors at his fingertips and palm send touch and
                    pressure information back to the sensory area of his brain
                    implant to restore sensation through a computer instead of
                    through the normal pathway through the spinal cord.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's almost like fooling the nervous system to make it
                    work," said Mehta.

                    in court. Lichtenstein has admitted that he used multiple
                    advanced hacking tools and techniques to gain entry into the
                    cryptocurrency exchange's network. He then authorized 2,000
                    transactions to move 119,754 bitcoins to wallets he
                    controlled. To cover his tracks, he said he deleted access
                    credentials, logs and other digital breadcrumbs that could
                    give him away. Morgan, his wife, helped him move and launder
                    the stolen funds.

                  <p>
                    If you'll recall, the Justice Department seized 95,000 of
                    the stolen bitcoins at the time of their arrest. Back then,
                    that digital coin hoard was worth a whopping $3.6 billion
                    and was the largest financial seizure in the agency's
                    history. Authorities were able to trace more of the stolen
                    funds after that to recover an additional $475 million worth
                    of cryptocurrency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the DOJ, Lichtenstein and Morgan used false
                    identities to set up online accounts on darknet markets and
                    cryptocurrency exchanges. They then withdrew the funds and
                    distributed the bitcoins from there by converting them into
                    other forms of cryptocurrency and keeping them in crypto
                    mixing services. By doing so, they obfuscated the coins'
                    sources and made them harder to trace.

                    [...] Brave argues that having its own index frees the
                    company from content decisions made by others. As an

                    inquiry that remains unwelcome in China. Brave Search also
                    couldn't find "tank man" at the time because the service
                    sourced its image results from Microsoft Bing.

                    Many of the most attractive premium features in Tesla
                    vehicles are things that all of the cars are physically
                    capable of but are locked down at the software level. Since
                    there are always security researchers and hackers trying to
                    pick those proverbial locks, it was inevitable that someone
                    would figure it out. And as of this week, that has finally
                    happened.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to a new report from

                    Berlin. They plan on presenting their findings at

                    "We are not the evil outsider, but we're actually the
                    insider, we own the car," researcher and TU Berlin Ph.D.
                    candidate Christian Werling told TechCrunch. "And we don't
                    want to pay these $300 for the rear heated seats."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Specifically, he and his colleagues used a technique called
                    voltage glitching or a voltage fault injection attack to
                    disrupt the AMD processor that powers the car's Tesla
                    Infotainment System and get it to do their bidding. "If we
                    do it at the right moment, we can trick the CPU into doing
                    something else," Welling added. "It has a hiccup, skips an
                    instruction, and accepts our manipulated code. That's
                    basically what we do in a nutshell."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the report, this new exploit could also enable
                    hackers to activate the $15,000 self-driving feature in
                    regions where it's locked out, though the researchers
                    haven't tried that themselves yet. But since the
                    vulnerability — while affecting software capabilities — is
                    hardware-based, Tesla can't patch it, with the researchers
                    telling TechCrunch that a fix would require replacing the
                    affected hardware. Tesla did not respond to TechCrunch's
                    request for comment on the exploit.

                    With more than two million visitors flocking to Japan last
                    month in the wake of the country's post-pandemic reopening,
                    railway companies are gearing up to warmly greet the influx

                    Seibu Railway, one of the country's large railroad
                    companies, is implementing a new simultaneous translation
                    system to help foreign tourists navigate Tokyo's metro which
                    is notorious for its complexity.

                    "The display we have introduced can automatically translate
                    between Japanese and other languages. When customers speak
                    in a foreign language, the station attendant can see it in
                    Japanese, and when the station attendant speaks Japanese,
                    customers can read the sentences in their own language,"
                    said Ayano Yajima, Seibu Railway Sales and Marketing

                    everything out, showing it and (there being)
                    misunderstandings. Having it like this, clear on the screen,
                    it's really nice," said Kevin Cometto, an Italian student
                    visiting Japan.

                    But with the translation window, a face-to-face conversation
                    through the screen is possible, complete with facial

                    customers with more complex requests such as seeking
                    directions or information about the local area.

                    Elon Musk's tunneling company has permission to
                    significantly expand its operations under the city of Las
                    Vegas. Last month, the Las Vegas City Council voted
                    unanimously to approve the Boring Company's plan to dig more
                    tunnels under the city, following in the steps of Clark
                    County,

                    to the tunneling concern. The company's plan calls for 68
                    miles of tunnels and 81 stations, served by a fleet of Tesla
                    electric vehicles, each able to carry three passengers at a
                    time.

                    said yes to a $48.6 million, 2.2-mile loop underneath the
                    convention center. In 2021, the LVCC Loop opened a 1.7-mile
                    network with three stations; the Boring Company claims it
                    has transported 1.15 million passengers, with a peak
                    capacity of just 4,500 people per hour. For context, a
                    subway system can be expected to carry between 600 and 1,000
                    people per train.

                    If you know anything about this subject, you've probably
                    heard that LLMs are trained to "predict the next word" and
                    that they require huge amounts of text to do this. But that
                    tends to be where the explanation stops. The details of how
                    they predict the next word is often treated as a deep
                    mystery.<br />[...]<br />To understand how language models
                    work, you first need to understand how they represent words.
                    Humans represent English words with a sequence of letters,
                    like C-A-T for "cat." Language models use a long list of
                    numbers called a "word vector." For example,
                    <a
                      href="http://vectors.nlpl.eu/explore/embeddings/en/MOD_enwiki_upos_skipgram_300_2_2021/cat_NOUN/"

                    >
                    to represent cat as a vector:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [0.0074, 0.0030, -0.0105, 0.0742, 0.0765, -0.0011, 0.0265,
                    0.0106, 0.0191, 0.0038, -0.0468, -0.0212, 0.0091, 0.0030,
                    -0.0563, -0.0396, -0.0998, -0.0796, ..., 0.0002]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (The full vector is 300 numbers long—to see it all,

                    and then click "show the raw vector.")
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Why use such a baroque notation? Here's an analogy.
                    Washington, DC, is located at 38.9 degrees north and 77
                    degrees west. We can represent this using a vector notation:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Washington, DC, is at [38.9, 77]</li>
                    <li>New York is at [40.7, 74]</li>
                    <li>London is at [51.5, 0.1]</li>
                    <li>Paris is at [48.9, -2.4]</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    This is useful for reasoning about spatial relationships.<br />[...]<br />For
                    example, the
                    <a

                    in vector space include dog, kitten, and pet. A key
                    advantage of representing words with vectors of real numbers
                    (as opposed to a string of letters, like C-A-T) is that
                    numbers enable operations that letters don't.

                    Words are too complex to represent in only two dimensions,
                    so language models use vector spaces with hundreds or even
                    thousands of dimensions.<br />[...]<br />Researchers have
                    been experimenting with word vectors for decades, but the
                    concept really took off when Google
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781"
                      >announced its word2vec project</a
                    >
                    in 2013. Google analyzed millions of documents harvested
                    from Google News to figure out which words tend to appear in
                    similar sentences. Over time, a neural network trained to
                    predict which words co-occur with other words learned to
                    place similar words (like dog and cat) close together in
                    vector space.<br />[...]<br />Because these vectors are
                    built from the way humans use words, they end up reflecting
                    many of the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aal4230"
                      >biases that are present in human language</a
                    >. For example, in some word vector models, "doctor minus
                    man plus woman" yields "nurse." Mitigating biases like this
                    is an area of active research.<br />[...]<br />Traditional
                    software is designed to operate on data that's unambiguous.
                    If you ask a computer to compute "2 + 3," there's no
                    ambiguity about what 2, +, or 3 mean. But natural language
                    is full of ambiguities that go beyond homonyms and polysemy:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      In "the customer asked the mechanic to fix his car," does
                      "his" refer to the customer or the mechanic?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In "the professor urged the student to do her homework"
                      does "her" refer to the professor or the student?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In "fruit flies like a banana" is "flies" a verb
                      (referring to fruit soaring across the sky) or a noun
                      (referring to banana-loving insects)?
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    People resolve ambiguities like this based on context, but
                    there are no simple or deterministic rules for doing this.
                    Rather, it requires understanding facts about the world. You
                    need to know that mechanics typically fix customers' cars,
                    that students typically do their own homework, and that
                    fruit typically doesn't fly.

                    Word vectors provide a flexible way for language models to
                    represent each word's precise meaning in the context of a
                    particular passage.<br />[...]<br /><a

                    that the first few layers focus on understanding the
                    sentence's syntax and resolving ambiguities like we've shown
                    above. Later layers (which we're not showing to keep the
                    diagram a manageable size) work to develop a high-level
                    understanding of the passage as a whole.<br />[...]<br />In
                    short, these nine attention heads enabled GPT-2 to figure
                    out that "John gave a drink to John" doesn't make sense and
                    choose "John gave a drink to Mary" instead.

                    We love this example because it illustrates just how
                    difficult it will be to fully understand LLMs. The
                    five-member Redwood team published a
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593">25-page paper</a>
                    explaining how they identified and validated these attention
                    heads. Yet even after they did all that work, we are still
                    far from having a comprehensive explanation for why GPT-2
                    decided to predict "Mary" as the next word.<br />[...]<br />In
                    a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14913">2020 paper</a>,
                    researchers from Tel Aviv University found that feed-forward
                    layers work by pattern matching: Each neuron in the hidden
                    layer matches a specific pattern in the input text.<br />[...]<br />Recent

                    revealed an elegant example of how feed-forward layers help
                    to predict the next word. Earlier, we discussed Google's
                    word2vec research showing it was possible to use vector
                    arithmetic to reason by analogy. For example, Berlin -
                    Germany + France = Paris.

                    The Brown researchers found that feed-forward layers
                    sometimes use this exact method to predict the next word.<br />[...]<br />All
                    the parts of LLMs we've discussed in this article so far—the
                    neurons in the feed-forward layers and the attention heads
                    that move contextual information between words—are
                    implemented as a chain of simple mathematical functions

                    model's weight parameters to control how information flows

                    five years, OpenAI has steadily increased the size of its
                    language models. In a
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361.pdf"
                      >widely read 2020 paper</a
                    >, OpenAI reported that the accuracy of its language models
                    scaled "as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and
                    the amount of compute used for training, with some trends
                    spanning more than seven orders of magnitude."

                    The larger their models got, the better they were at tasks
                    involving language. But this was only true if they increased
                    the amount of training data by a similar factor. And to
                    train larger models on more data, you need a lot more
                    computing power.<br />[...]<br />Psychologists call this
                    capacity to reason about the mental states of other people
                    "theory of mind." Most people have this capacity from the
                    time they're in grade school.

                    quoted above and then asked them to complete a sentence like
                    "she believes that the bag is full of." The correct answer
                    is "chocolate," but an unsophisticated language model might

                  <p>
                    For example, one researcher asked GPT-4 to draw a unicorn
                    using an obscure graphics programming language called TiKZ.
                    GPT-4 responded with a few lines of code that the researcher
                    then fed into the TiKZ software. The resulting images were
                    crude, but they showed clear signs that GPT-4 had some
                    understanding of what unicorns look like.<br />[...]<br />At
                    the moment, we don't have any real insight into how LLMs
                    accomplish feats like this. Some people argue that such
                    examples demonstrate that the models are starting to truly
                    understand the meanings of the words in their training set.

                    without truly understanding them.<br />[...]<br />Further,
                    prediction may be foundational to biological intelligence as
                    well as artificial intelligence.

                      >In the view of philosophers like Andy Clark</a
                    >, the human brain can be thought of as a "prediction
                    machine" whose primary job is to make predictions about our
                    environment that can then be used to navigate that
                    environment successfully.<br />[...]<br />Traditionally, a
                    major challenge for building language models was figuring
                    out the most useful way of representing different
                    words—especially because the meanings of many words depend
                    heavily on context. The next-word prediction approach allows
                    researchers to sidestep this thorny theoretical puzzle by
                    turning it into an empirical problem. It turns out that if
                    we provide enough data and computing power, language models
                    end up learning a lot about how human language works simply
                    by figuring out how to best predict the next word. The
                    downside is that we wind up with systems whose inner
                    workings we don't fully understand.

                    While 21st century water companies struggle to maintain
                    clean, fresh supplies, new research from an international
                    team led by Oxford geoarchaeologist Dr. Güel Sürmelihindi,
                    reveals that, some 2,000 years ago, Roman water engineers
                    were keeping up a regular program of managing and
                    maintaining the ancient water systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the research, published in
                    <em>Scientific Reports,</em> ancient water management traces
                    are captured in the limescale deposits which built up on the
                    walls and floor of the ancient Roman aqueduct of Divona
                    (Cahors, France).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The evidence shows that these deposits were regularly and
                    partially removed during maintenance. It reveals, "The
                    discovery of traces of regular maintenance in the carbonate
                    deposits... such as tool marks, calcite deformation twins,
                    debris from cleaning and repairs...are proof of periodic
                    manual carbonate removal by Roman maintenance teams.

                    Once, many years ago, I stayed on the 62nd floor of the
                    Westin Peachtree Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia. This was in the
                    age when the price of a hotel room was directly correlated
                    with the price of the WiFi service, and as a high school
                    student I was not prepared to pay in excess of $15 a day for
                    the internet. As I remember, a Motel 6 that was not blocks
                    away but within line of sight ended up filling the role. But
                    even up there, 62 floors from the ground, there was false
                    promise: Free Public WiFi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I am not the first person to write on this phenomenon, I
                    think I originally came to understand it as a result of a
                    2010 segment of All Things Considered. For a period of a few
                    years, almost everywhere you went, there was a WiFi network
                    called "Free Public WiFi." While it was both free and public
                    in the most literal sense, it did not offer internet access.
                    It was totally useless, and fell somewhere between a joke, a
                    scam, and an accident of history. Since I'm not the first to
                    write about it, I have to be the most thorough, and so let's
                    start out with a discussion of WiFi itself.

                    The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has taken an
                    astonishing new image of the Ring Nebula. This glowing,
                    donut-shaped nebula has never been seen in such intricate
                    detail before.

                    The Ring Nebula is about 2600 light years away in the
                    direction of the constellation Lyra. It is what astronomers
                    call a planetary nebula, which forms when

                    By chance, this nebula happens to be oriented so that from
                    Earth we view it face-on, with the stellar corpse in the
                    centre circled by its titular ring of bright nitrogen and
                    sulfur. The whole thing is enveloped in a veil of

                    Yoran has more to add to the senator’s arguments, writing in
                    his post that Microsoft has demonstrated a “repeated pattern
                    of negligent cybersecurity practices,” enabling Chinese
                    hackers to spy on the US government. He also revealed
                    Tenable’s discovery of an

                      href="https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2023-25?x-clickref=1011lxHkyXa3x-promotion-id=afffiliate"

                    in Microsoft Azure and says the company took too long to
                    address it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tenable initially discovered the flaw in March and found
                    that it could give bad actors access to a company’s
                    sensitive data, including a bank. Yoran claims Microsoft
                    took “more than 90 days to implement a partial fix” after
                    Tenable notified the company, adding that the fix only
                    applies to “new applications loaded in the service.”
                    According to Yoran, the bank and all the other organizations
                    “that had launched the service prior to the fix” are still
                    affected by the flaw — and are likely unaware of that risk.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yoran says Microsoft plans to fix the issue by the end of
                    September but calls the delayed response “grossly
                    irresponsible, if not blatantly negligent.” He also points
                    to data from Google’s Project Zero, which indicates that
                    Microsoft products have made up 42.5 percent of all
                    discovered zero-day vulnerabilities since 2014.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “What you hear from Microsoft is ‘just trust us,’ but what
                    you get back is very little transparency and a culture of
                    toxic obfuscation,” Yoran writes. “How can a CISO, board of
                    directors or executive team believe that Microsoft will do
                    the right thing given the fact patterns and current
                    behaviors?”

                    the previous record holder – Rising Eagle and JSquared
                    Telecom – by nearly $75 million in 2020. After a lengthy
                    investigation, the Commission decided on Thursday to proceed
                    with the huge fine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The record-breaking punishment goes to an illegal
                    transnational robocalling operation. The outfit is so big
                    (or so blatantly illegal) that it does not have an official
                    umbrella company. It's more of a network of cooperating
                    businesses that made more than five billion automated calls
                    to over 500 million phone numbers within a three-month
                    period in 2021.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In doing so, the FCC says the organized operation broke
                    multiple federal laws by spoofing more than one million
                    telephone numbers to hide their actual origin and trick
                    people into answering the calls. It also violated numerous
                    other FCC regulations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The operation has allegedly been around since 2018 and
                    primarily sold consumers vehicle service contracts falsely
                    disguised as auto warranties. Two primary bad actors – Roy
                    M. Cox and Aaron Michael Jones – already hold lifetime bans
                    from running telemarketing businesses after losing a lawsuit
                    brought on them by the FCC and the State of Texas. Business
                    names associated with the illegal enterprise include Sumco
                    Panama, Virtual Telecom, Davis Telecom, Geist Telecom, Fugle
                    Telecom, Tech Direct, Mobi Telecom, and Posting Express.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It's hard to nail down robocallers, but it's at least
                    nice to see the FCC trying to hit them with huge penalties
                    instead of laughable

                    A new study has shown that humans may have evolved a
                    spring-like arch to help us walk on two feet. Researchers
                    studying the evolution of
                    <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/subjects/bipedal"

                    walking have long assumed that the raised arch of the foot
                    helps us walk by acting as a lever which propels the body
                    forward. But a global team of scientists have now found that
                    the recoil of the flexible arch repositions the ankle
                    upright for more effective walking. The effects in running
                    are greater, which suggests that the ability to run
                    efficiently could have been a selective pressure for a
                    flexible arch that made walking more efficient too. This
                    discovery could even help doctors improve treatments for
                    present-day patients' foot problems.

                    "We thought originally that the spring-like arch helped to
                    lift the body into the next step," said Dr Lauren Welte,
                    first author of the study in
                    <a

                    and is now affiliated with the University of
                    Wisconsin-Madison. "It turns out that instead, the
                    spring-like arch recoils to help the ankle lift the body."

                    The evolution of our feet, including the raised medial arch
                    which sets us apart from
                    <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/subjects/great-apes"
                      >great apes</a
                    >, is crucial to bipedal walking. The arch is thought to
                    give hominins more leverage when walking upright: the
                    mechanism is unclear, but when arch motion is restricted,
                    running demands more energy. Arch recoil could potentially
                    make us more efficient runners by propelling the center mass
                    of the body forward, or by making up for mechanical work
                    that muscles would otherwise have to do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Although the scientists expected to find that arch
                    recoil helped the rigid lever of the arch to lift the body
                    up, they discovered that a rigid arch without recoil either
                    caused the foot to leave the ground early, likely decreasing
                    the efficiency of the calf muscles, or leaned the ankle
                    bones too far forward. The forward lean mirrors the posture
                    of walking chimpanzees, rather than the upright stance
                    characteristic of human gait. The flexible arch helped
                    reposition the ankle upright, which allows the leg to push
                    off the ground more effectively. This effect is even greater
                    when running, suggesting that efficient running may have
                    been an evolutionary pressure in favor of the flexible arch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The mobility of our feet seems to allow us to walk
                    and run upright instead of either crouching forward or
                    pushing off into the next step too soon," said Dr Michael
                    Rainbow of Queen's University, senior author.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These findings also suggest therapeutic avenues for people
                    whose arches are rigid due to injury or illness: supporting
                    the flexibility of the arch could improve overall mobility.

                    The update will come into effect on February 1, 2024, when
                    AWS customers will see a charge of $0.005 (half a cent) per
                    IP address per hour for all public IPv4 addresses. These
                    charges will apparently apply whether the address is
                    attached to a service or not, and like many AWS charges,
                    appear inconsequential at first glance but can mount up over
                    time if a customer is using many of them.

                  <p>
                    African cuckoos may have met their match with the
                    fork-tailed drongo, which scientists predict can detect and
                    reject cuckoo eggs from their nest on almost every occasion,
                    despite them on average looking almost identical to drongo
                    eggs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fork-tailed drongos, belligerent birds from sub-Saharan
                    Africa, lay eggs with a staggering diversity of colors and
                    patterns. All these colors and patterns are forged by the
                    African cuckoo.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    African cuckoos lay their eggs in drongos' nests to avoid
                    rearing their chick themselves (an example of so-called
                    brood parasitism). By forging drongo egg colors and
                    patterns, cuckoos trick drongos into thinking the cuckoo egg
                    is one of their own.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But drongos use knowledge of their own personal egg
                    "signatures"—their eggs' color and pattern –to identify
                    cuckoo egg "forgeries" and reject them from their nests, say
                    scientists. These "signatures" are like the signatures we
                    use in our daily lives: unique to each individual and highly
                    repeatable by the same individual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Through natural selection, the African cuckoo's eggs have
                    evolved to look almost-identical to drongo eggs—a rare
                    example of high-fidelity mimicry in nature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A team led by researchers at the University of Cambridge and
                    the University of Cape Town, working in collaboration with a
                    community in Zambia, set out to explore the effectiveness of
                    "signatures" as a defense against highly accurate mimicry.
                    The findings are published today in the journal,
                    <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They found that despite near-perfect mimicry of fork-tailed
                    drongo eggs, African cuckoo eggs still have a high
                    probability of being rejected.

                    The plaintiffs are 20 producers of popular movies who are
                    trying to prove that Internet service provider Grande is
                    liable for its subscribers' copyright infringement because
                    the ISP allegedly ignores piracy on its network. Reddit
                    isn't directly involved in the copyright case. But the film
                    companies filed a motion to compel Reddit to respond to a
                    subpoena demanding "basic account information including IP
                    address registration and logs from 1/1/2016 to present,
                    name, email address and other account registration
                    information" for six users who wrote comments on Reddit
                    threads in 2011 and 2018.

                    the statute of limitations is irrelevant to whether the
                    comments can provide evidence in the case against Grande.

                    [...] When a court evaluates an unmasking request, it
                    considers whether a subpoena "was issued in good faith and
                    not for any improper purpose," whether "the identifying
                    information is directly and materially relevant" to a core
                    claim or defense, and whether "information sufficient to
                    establish or to disprove that claim or defense is
                    unavailable from any other source," the ruling said.

                  <p>
                    [...] The fact that Grande already provided names of 118
                    subscribers factored into Beeler's explanation of why she
                    denied the film companies' motion.
