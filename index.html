                    [T]he most alarming aspect of deepfakes is their ability to
                    provide bad actors with plausible deniability, allowing them
                    to dismiss genuine content as fake. This erosion of public
                    trust strikes at the very core of our social fabric and the
                    foundations of our democracy. The human brain, wired to
                    believe what it sees and hears, is particularly vulnerable
                    to the deception of deepfakes. As these technologies become
                    increasingly sophisticated, they threaten to undermine the
                    shared sense of reality that underpins our society, creating
                    a climate of uncertainty and skepticism where citizens are
                    left questioning the veracity of every piece of information

                    The physicists found that a tachyon cosmological model was
                    just as good at explaining the supernova data as the
                    standard cosmological model involving dark matter and dark
                    energy. That itself is a surprise, given how unorthodox this
                    idea is.

                  <p>
                    However, that's only the beginning. We now have access to a
                    wealth of data about the large-scale universe, like the
                    cosmic microwave background (remnant radiation released just
                    after the Big Bang) and the arrangement of galaxies at the
                    very largest scales. The next step is to continue testing
                    this idea against those additional observations.

                  <p>
                    The tachyon cosmological model is unlikely to pass those
                    rigorous experimental tests, given the unlikely nature of
                    tachyons. But continuing to push in new, even unorthodox,
                    directions is important in

                    Scientists have been attempting to understand dark matter
                    for 50 years and dark energy for a quarter century, without
                    any conclusive results. The solutions to these conundrums

                is a species of algae, a coastal coccolithophore in the fossil

                to have engulfed a cyanobacterium that lets them do something
                that algae, and plants in general, can't normally do: "fixing"
                nitrogen straight from the air, and combining it with other
                elements to create more useful compounds.

                    Nitrogen is a key nutrient, and normally plants and algae
                    get theirs through symbiotic relationships with bacteria
                    that remain separate. At first it was thought that B.
                    bigelowii had hooked up this kind of situation with a
                    bacterium called UCYN-A, but on closer inspection,
                    scientists discovered that the two have gotten far more
                    intimate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In one recent study, a team found that the size ratio
                    between the algae and UCYN-A stays similar across different
                    related species of the algae. Their growth appears to be
                    controlled by the exchange of nutrients, leading to linked
                    metabolisms.

                    "That's exactly what happens with organelles," said Jonathan
                    Zehr, an author of the studies. "If you look at the
                    mitochondria and the chloroplast, it's the same thing: they
                    scale with the cell."

                    In a follow-up study, the team and other collaborators used
                    a powerful X-ray imaging technique to view the interior of
                    the living algae cells. This revealed that the replication
                    and cell division was synchronized between the host and

                    And finally, the team compared the proteins of isolated
                    UCYN-A to those inside the algal cells. They found that the
                    isolated bacterium can only produce about half of the
                    proteins it needs, relying on the algal host to provide the
                    rest.

                    "That's one of the hallmarks of something moving from an
                    endosymbiont to an organelle," said Zehr. "They start
                    throwing away pieces of DNA, and their genomes get smaller
                    and smaller, and they start depending on the mother cell for
                    those gene products – or the protein itself – to be
                    transported into the cell."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Altogether, the team says this indicates UCYN-A is a full
                    organelle, which is given the name of nitroplast. It appears
                    that this began to evolve around 100 million years ago,
                    which sounds like an incredibly long time but is a blink of
                    an eye compared to mitochondria and chloroplasts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers plan to continue studying nitroplasts, to
                    find out if they're present in other cells and what effects
                    they may have. One possible benefit is that it could give
                    scientists a new avenue to incorporate nitrogen-fixing into
                    plants to grow better crops.

                The culprit of service is the second generation of the EU's
                Cybersecurity Directive (NIS2). The new legislation widely
                extends its
                <a
                  href="https://ccb.belgium.be/sites/default/files/NIS-2%20Scope%20visual.pdf"
                  >scope</a
                >
                to nearly any company with more than 50 employees and €10M+ in
                yearly revenue. On top of that, the number of industrial sectors
                which are deemed essential in terms of critical infrastructure
                doubles from 6 to 12, including ICT service management,
                government institutions, post and courier services,
                manufacturing companies, the food-processing industry, waste
                water management, space companies, research organisations and
                the chemical industry as a whole. Suppliers to these companies
                can also fall under the new regulation.
              </p>
              <p>
                In practice, national centers for cybersecurity will be
                responsible to execute cybersecurity checks through audits
                and/or unannounced security scans. If the target company
                neglects their recommendations, it risks heavy fines: at least 2
                percent of worldwide revenue up to a maximum of €10 million for
                companies with more than 250 employees, or more than €50 million
                yearly revenue. Smaller companies risk at least 1.4 percent of
                yearly revenue with a maximum of €7 million.
              </p>
              <p>
                These fines cannot just be classified under company expenses,
                though. Under the new regulation, CEOs and board members are
                obligated to follow cybersecurity training, and to sign off on
                all cybersecurity measures. They are deemed personally
                responsible, and run the risk of being barred temporarily from
                similar roles, and -- most importantly -- of having to pay the
                resulting fine out of their own pocket, not through the company.

                    Production of some models of Z80 processor – the chip that
                    helped spark the PC boom of the 1980s – will cease in June
                    2024 after an all-too-brief 48 years.

                  <p>
                    The Z80 debuted in 1976, using a 4-micron process. Readers
                    will doubtless be aware that some modern silicon is made on
                    a 4-nanometer process – meaning elements are 1,000 times
                    smaller than those etched into a Z80.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Zilog will accept orders for the device until June 14, 2024.
                    After that, it's the end for the eight-bit CPU – or at least
                    the ZC8400 range. Zilog appears to still make the Z180 and
                    eZ80 – successors that added lots of whistles and bells and
                    are often packaged into SoCs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The original Z80 packed just 8,500 transistors and chugged
                    along at 2.5Mhz, but that was enough to power lots of fun
                    stuff – helped by the fact that it was compatible with
                    Intel's 8080 processor and sold at a cheaper price.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Sinclair ZX range was perhaps the most famous
                    application of the Z80, using it to power affordable and
                    accessible machines that
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/09/19/remembering_clive_sinclair/"

                    >
                    (and writers) to tech. The chip also found its way into
                    arcade games such as Pac Man, and early Roland synthesizers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But Zilog was overtaken by Intel in the PC market, and by
                    the 1990s decided to focus on microcontrollers instead. The
                    Z80 was one of its key offerings, and over the years was
                    adapted and enhanced: we even spotted a new variant of the
                    chip in
                    <a

                  <p>
                    That sort of upgrade helped the processor and its heirs to
                    hold on in some consumer-facing applications such as
                    graphing calculators like the TI-84 Plus CE. But it mostly
                    disappeared into industrial kit, where it hummed along
                    reliably and offered developers a tried-and-true target for
                    their code.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Perhaps someone will place a giant order for ZC8400s to
                    hoard them, so that those committed to the platform can
                    continue to get kit – a plausible scenario given the
                    likelihood the processor retains a hidden-but-critical role
                    in defense or some legacy tech that will persist for
                    decades.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Or perhaps there's one last batch of ZX Spectrums to be
                    made!

                    In what has been hailed as a milestone moment for artificial
                    intelligence's use in the military, the US Air Force has
                    announced that it successfully tested a modified,
                    AI-controlled fighter jet in a dogfight against human pilots
                    last year.

                    The US Air Force Test Pilot School and the Defense Advanced
                    Research Projects Agency (DARPA) first started testing a
                    Lockheed Martin X-62A VISTA (Variable In-flight Simulation
                    Test Aircraft) fitted with AI software back in

                    on Thursday that in September 2023, the X-62A carried out
                    the first successful AI versus human within-visual-range
                    engagements, also known as a dogfight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The AI dogfights paired the X-62A VISTA against manned F-16
                    aircraft in the skies above Edwards Air Force Base in Kern
                    County, California. After initial flight safety was built up
                    using defensive maneuvers, the aircraft switched to
                    offensive high-aspect nose-to-nose engagements where they
                    approached within 2,000 feet of each other at 1,200 miles
                    per hour. It isn't revealed which side won the simulated
                    battle.

                    [...] In addition to its autonomous flight capabilities, the
                    X-62A VISTA, a modified F-16, also features a
                    high-resolution camera, a compact size, lightweight
                    construction, and is versatile enough to be used for a wide
                    range of applications, including scientific research,
                    surveillance, recon, environmental monitoring, and emergency
                    response.

                    Could Air Force pilots be yet another profession that is
                    eventually threatened by AI? The 2020
                    <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2020-08-26"
                      >AlphaDogfight Trials</a

                    algorithms capable of dogfighting (using VR simulations),
                    saw an experienced F-16 Air Force pilot lose 5-0 to the AI
                    agent. DARPA said the machine performed aggressive and
                    precise maneuvers that the human pilot could not match.

                  <p>
                    DARPA says that the X-62A VISTA will continue to serve a
                    variety of customers for research while providing key
                    academic lessons for the next generation of test leaders.

                        It wasn't clear what tool it was, but let's make sure it
                        gets fixed. Because if you can't parse tabs as
                        whitespace, you should not be parsing the kernel Kconfig
                        files.

                        In fact, let's make such breakage more obvious than some
                        esoteric ftrace record size option. If you can't parse
                        tabs, you can't have page sizes.

                      <p>
                        Yes, tab-vs-space confusion is sadly a traditional Unix
                        thing, and 'make' is famous for being broken in this
                        regard. But no, that does not mean that it's ok.

                    the model of a publicly engaged academic, someone who wrote
                    substantive books that anyone could read and who had a real

                    and free will. "Our only notable divergence was on the
                    question of free will, which Dan maintained exists, in some
                    sense of 'free,' whereas I just agreed that 'will' exists,
                    but maintained that there is no freedom in it," Hoftstadter

              <p>
                I initially came across Dennett's writings in his book
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mind's_I"
                  >The Mind's I</a
                >
                which he wrote with Douglas Hofstader including texts from other
                authors. It was when I first started to dip my toes into the
                philosopy of mind. He brings up some fascinating ideas from a
                rational perspective which always provoke a lot of thought and
                discussion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to my being in the same philosophical camp as Dennett's
                great rival David Chalmers, I tend to side with those who called
                Denett's book,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness_explained"
                  >Consciousness Explained</a
                >, Consciousness Avoided (Dennett actually wrote an epilogue in
                response to this accusation). This is because, as I understand
                it, Dennett has always strived to explain consciousness using
                only axioms derived directly from accepted science, which means
                it all starts and ends with a third person perspective. Dennett
                always raised some interesting counterarguments to other
                philosophers that attempted to discuss the really interesting
                first person phenomena of consciousness, so whether you agree
                with him or not, he represented a key school of thought in
                modern philosophy.

                    report this week. While Prime Video users aren't the only
                    streaming users dealing with these problems, Insider's
                    examination of leaked "internal documents" brings more
                    perspective into the impact of mislabeling and similar

                    Insider didn't publish the documents but said they show that
                    "60 percent of all content-related customer-experience
                    complaints for Prime Video last year were about catalogue

                    reported that an unnamed source it described as "familiar
                    with the matter" said the documents were out of date,
                    despite Insider claiming that the leaked reports included
                    data from 2023. Quartz's source also claimed that customer
                    engagement was not affected,

                    Ars Technica reached out to Amazon for comment but didn't
                    hear back in time for publication. The company told Insider
                    that "catalogue quality is an ongoing priority" and that
                    Amazon takes "it seriously and work[s] relentlessly

                    Eric S Raymond has released version 0.2 of Autodafe, his
                    latest open-source project that provides "tools for freeing
                    your project from the clammy grip of Autotools."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Autodafe works to convert an Autotools build recipe into a
                    bare makefile that "can be read and modified by humans." The
                    Autodafe's README explains:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                            "This project collects resources for converting an
                    autotools build recipe to a bare makefile that can be read
                    and modified by humans.<br />
                            ...<br />
                            The principal tool, makemake, reduces a generated
                    Makefile to an equivalent form suitable for human
                    modification and with internal automake cruft removed. It is
                    intended to be used with ifdex(1) to enable severing a
                    project from its autotools build recipe, leaving a bare
                    Makefile in place. A HOWTO describing a conversion workflow
                    for an entire project is included.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                            One other tool is planned but not yet implemented."

                    Those wishing to learn more about ESR's Autodafe project can
                    do so via GitLab.<br /><a

                  <p>
                            "Release 0.2 of my autotools killer. It's ready for
                    use on projects buiilding binaries or static libraries.
                    Shared libraries is a more difficult problem and will gate
                    the 1.0 release."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is one way to work away from Autotools for those not
                    wishing to join the Meson bandwagon or going to another
                    build system outright.

                This project intrigues me. It brings sanity to GNU. I consider
                Unix M4 (core macro language of Autotools) inferior even as a
                macro language.<br />I am used to craft a Makefile for my
                projects by hand, for decades. Having a humanized Makefile for
                fancy projects of others seems nice to me.

                University of Queensland researchers have built a generator that
                absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) to make electricity.
              </p>
              <p>
                "This nanogenerator is made of two components: a polyamine gel
                that is already used by industry to absorb CO2 and a skeleton a
                few atoms thick of boron nitrate that generates positive and
                negative ions," Dr Wang said.
              </p>
              <p>
                "In nature and in the human body, ion transportation is the most
                efficient energy conversion – more efficient than electron
                transportation which is used in the power network."
              </p>
              <p>
                "At present we can harvest around 1 per cent of the total energy
                carried intrinsically by gas CO2 but like other technologies, we
                will now work on improving efficiency and reducing cost."
              </p>
              <p>
                "We could make a slightly bigger device that is portable to
                generate electricity to power a mobile phone or a laptop
                computer using CO2 from the atmosphere," Professor Zhang said.
              </p>
              <p>
                "A second application on a much larger scale, would integrate
                this technology with an industrial CO2 capture process to
                harvest electricity."

                    Colorado Governor Jared Polis on Wednesday signed into law
                    the first measure passed in the U.S. that aims to protect
                    the data found in a person's brainwaves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sponsors of the bill said it was necessary as quick advances
                    in neurotechnology make scanning, analyzing and selling
                    mental data increasingly more possible - and profitable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    State representative Cathy Kipp, a sponsor of the
                    legislation, said in a statement that while advancements in
                    the neurotechnology field hold great promise for improving
                    the lives of many people, "we must provide a clear framework
                    to protect Coloradans' personal data from being used without
                    their consent while still allowing these new technologies to
                    develop."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    State senator Kevin Priola, another of the bill's sponsors,
                    said that neurotechnology "is no longer confined to medical
                    or research settings" and that when it comes to consumer
                    products, the industry "can currently operate without
                    regulation, data protection standards, or equivalent ethical
                    constraints."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Colorado law notes that neuratechnologies used in a
                    clinical setting are already covered by medical privacy
                    laws, so the new measure is aimed at consumer products
                    available outside of a hospital.

                    prevented some Windows 10 systems from upgrading to Windows

                    back then [Nov 2021] that certain versions of drivers for
                    Intel Smart Sound Technology (SST) could trip up the newest
                    version of its Windows operating system – Windows 11 – and
                    so threw up a compatibility hold to stop users updating from
                    Windows 10 and encountering blue screen unpleasantness.

                    According to Microsoft: "Only devices with both an Intel

                    10.29.0.5152 or 10.30.0.5152 are affected by this issue."

                    [...] It is debatable how many users are still affected by

                        spacing in the mandible itself is very specifically and
                        characteristically human, or at least related and very
                        recent hominid relative/ancestor. Most likely human
                        given the success of the proliferation of H.s. and the
                        (relatively) rapid formation of travertine.

                        Against modern Homo sapiens, which may not be entirely
                        relevant, the morphology of the mandible is likely not
                        northern European, but more similar to African, middle
                        Eastern, mainland Asian.

                    cut. And one is far more likely to find fossils of algae,

                    [...] The research team focused on two particular elements:
                    sulfur and chlorine. Sulfur has two common non-radioactive
                    isotopes, 32S and 34S, and chlorine, its neighbor on the
                    periodic table, has 35Cl and 37Cl. There are differences in
                    the ratio of these isotopes throughout the bodies of the
                    Solar System, but those differences are generally small.
                    And, because we think we know what sort of material
                    contributed to the formation of Io, we can focus on the
                    ratios found in bodies that have a similar origin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chlorine enters the atmosphere from volcanoes primarily in
                    the form of sodium and potassium salts. These have a very
                    short half-life before they're split up by exposure to light
                    and radiation. The ALMA data indicated both these chemicals
                    were present in localized regions, likely corresponding to
                    active volcanic plumes. The data from the chlorine isotopes
                    were a bit noisy, so were largely used as a sanity check for
                    the ones obtained from sulfur isotopes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The intriguing thing about this—or at least one of
                    them—is that it implies that Io has some system that's
                    cycling the sulfur dioxide that erupts to the surface back
                    into the interior of the moon where it can take part in
                    volcanism again. There's no indication of any plate
                    tectonics on the moon, so we don't have a clear analog for
                    what can be driving the process on Io.

                    burglars, unwanted animal guests, and any hapless passersby
                    who fail to heed its "zero compliance, zero tolerance"
                    warning.<br />[...]<br />"Experience ultimate peace of

                    declares, as Eve will offer owners a "perfect fusion of

                    "unintrusive [sic] design that stands as a beacon of
                    safety."<br />[...]<br />There are apparently "Standard,"
                    "Advanced," and "Elite" versions of PaintCam Eve in the
                    works. The basic tier only gets owners "smart security" and
                    "app on/off" capabilities, while Eve+ also offers animal
                    detection. Eve Pro apparently is the only one to include
                    facial recognition, which implies the other two models could
                    be a tad more... indiscriminate in their surveillance
                    methodologies. It's unclear how much extra you'll need to
                    shell out for the teargas tier, too.

                    According to the Reuters Institute for the Study of
                    Journalism, more than 75 percent of America's leading
                    newspapers, magazines, and journals are behind online
                    paywalls. And how do American news consumers react to that?
                    Almost 80 percent of Americans steer around those paywalls
                    and seek out a free option.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Paywalls create a two-tiered system: credible, fact-based
                    information for people who are willing to pay for it, and
                    murkier, less-reliable information for everyone else. Simply
                    put, paywalls get in the way of informing the public, which
                    is the mission of journalism. And they get in the way of the
                    public being informed, which is the foundation of democracy.
                    It is a terrible time for the press to be failing at
                    reaching people, during an election in which democracy is on
                    the line. There's a simple, temporary solution: Publications
                    should suspend their paywalls for all 2024 election coverage
                    and all information that is beneficial to voters. Democracy
                    does not die in darkness—it dies behind paywalls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem is not just that professionally produced news is
                    behind a wall; the problem is that paywalls increase the
                    proportion of free and easily available stories that are
                    actually filled with misinformation and disinformation. Way
                    back in 1995 (think America Online), the UCLA professor
                    Eugene Volokh predicted that the rise of "cheap speech"—free
                    internet content—would not only democratize mass media by
                    allowing new voices, but also increase the proliferation of
                    misinformation and conspiracy theories, which would then
                    destabilize mass media.
                  </p>

                    [...] Digital-news consumers can be divided into three
                    categories: a small, elite group that pays hundreds to
                    thousands of dollars a year for high-end subscriptions; a
                    slightly larger group of people with one to three news
                    subscriptions; and the roughly 80 percent of Americans who
                    will not or cannot pay for information. Some significant
                    percentage of this latter category are what scholars call
                    "passive" news consumers—people who do not seek out
                    information, but wait for it to come to them, whether from
                    their social feeds, from friends, or from a TV in an
                    airport. Putting reliable information behind paywalls
                    increases the likelihood that passive news consumers will
                    receive bad information.

                    [...] Part of the problem with the current, free news
                    environment is that the platform companies, which are the
                    largest distributors of free news, have deprioritized news.
                    [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As the platforms have diminished news, they have also
                    weakened their integrity and content-moderation teams, which
                    enforce community standards or terms of service. No major
                    platform permits false advertising, child pornography, hate
                    speech, or speech that leads to violence; the integrity and
                    moderation teams take down such content. A recent paper from
                    Barrett's team at the NYU Stern Center for Business and
                    Human Rights argues that the greatest tech-related threat in
                    2024 is not artificial intelligence or foreign election
                    interference, but something more mundane: the retreat from
                    content moderation and the hollowing-out of trust-and-safety
                    units and election-integrity teams. The increase in bad
                    information on the free web puts an even greater burden on
                    fact-based news reporting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now AI-created clickbait is also a growing threat.
                    Generative AI's ability to model, scrape, and even
                    plagiarize real news—and then tailor it to users—is
                    extraordinary. AI clickbait mills, posing as legitimate
                    journalistic organizations, are churning out content that
                    rips off real news and reporting. These plagiarism mills are
                    receiving funding because, well, they're cheap and
                    profitable. For now, Google's rankings don't appear to make
                    a distinction between a news article written by a human
                    being and one written by an AI chatbot. They can, and they
                    should.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The best way to address these challenges is for newsrooms to
                    remove or suspend their paywalls for stories related to the
                    2024 election. I am mindful of the irony of putting this
                    plea behind The Atlantic's own paywall, but that's exactly
                    where the argument should be made. If you're reading this,
                    you've probably paid to support journalism that you think
                    matters in the world. Don't you want it to be available to
                    others, too, especially those who would not otherwise get to
                    see it?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Good journalism isn't cheap, but outlets can find
                    creative ways to pay for their reporting on the election.
                    They can enlist foundations or other sponsors to underwrite
                    their work. They can turn to readers who are willing to
                    subscribe, renew their subscriptions, or make added
                    donations to subsidize important coverage during a crucial
                    election. And they can take advantage of the broader
                    audience that unpaywalled stories can reach, using it to
                    generate more advertising revenue—and even more civic-minded
                    subscribers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] I believe it was a mistake to give away journalism for
                    free in the 1990s. Information is not and never has been
                    free. I devoutly believe that news organizations need to
                    survive and figure out a revenue model that allows them to
                    do so. But the most important mission of a news organization
                    is to provide the public with information that allows
                    citizens to make the best decisions in a constitutional
                    democracy. Our government derives its legitimacy from the
                    consent of the governed, and that consent is arrived at
                    through the free flow of information—reliable, fact-based
                    information. To that end, news organizations should put
                    their election content in front of their paywall. The
                    Constitution protects the press so that the press can
                    protect constitutional democracy. Now the press must fulfill
                    its end of the bargain.

                        been accused of vandalizing multiple houses with bricks
                        in Sacramento. Authorities are investigating the claims
                        after several individuals reported their houses being
                        damaged, with windows shattered by bricks. Klay Thompson
                        has not yet issued a statement regarding the
                        accusations. The incidents have left the community
                        shaken, but no injuries were reported. The motive behind
                        the alleged vandalism remains unclear.

                    The study also found that different bird species have
                    different impacts in terms of seed dispersal. Smaller birds
                    disperse more seeds, but they can only spread small seeds
                    from trees with lower carbon storage potential. In contrast,
                    larger birds such as the Toco toucan or the Curl-crested jay
                    disperse the seeds of trees with a higher carbon storage
                    potential. The problem is that the larger birds are less
                    likely to move across highly fragmented landscapes.

                    "This crucial information enables us to pinpoint active
                    restoration efforts—like tree planting—in landscapes falling
                    below this forest cover threshold, where assisted

                    "Allowing larger frugivores to move freely across forest

                    also in the Crowther Lab at ETH Zurich and lead author of
                    the study. "This study demonstrates that especially in
                    tropical ecosystems seed dispersal mediated by birds, plays
                    a fundamental role in determining the species that can
                    regenerate."

                    identify areas where natural regeneration is possible, as
                    well as areas where we need to actively plant trees,

                    But the emergence of genAI and how LLMs are trained is a
                    particular concern for some organizations, Condo says. “It’s
                    public information that tools like GitHub Copilot use source
                    code from public [version control] systems they host to
                    train their model,” he says. “Buyers need to decide if they
                    are comfortable with that or if they would prefer their code
                    not be used for that purpose.”

                    Organizations with sensitive algorithms or concerns that
                    intellectual property (IP) will be leaked need to look for
                    safeguards to protect their IP from being used as training
                    data, Condo says. “If the goal is to share the IP as an
                    open-sourced project, it might be perfectly fine, as long as
                    the customer can decide,” he says.

                  <p>
                    Since Hemi engines are impressive, you're probably wondering
                    why every engine has yet to adopt a similar design. One
                    problem with a Hemi is that its unique cylinder head and
                    valve placement require the engine components to be
                    resituated to avoid obstructions. The unfortunate byproduct
                    of this rearrangement is a much more substantial footprint
                    that adds greater dimensions and weight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some of the first Hemi's reportedly tipped the scales at up
                    to 1,000 pounds before Chrysler began improving its engine
                    builds. The difference in weight between Hemi and non-Hemi
                    engines is much smaller now but still impactful; for
                    example, the Chrysler 5.7-liter 345 Hemi V8 is 560 pounds,
                    but the new high-output twin-turbo 3.0-liter Hurricane
                    inline-6 weighs only 430 pounds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As robust as the Hemi engine is in terms of power, it's
                    inefficient compared to other engines. In fact, the 2025 RAM
                    1500 is ditching the Hemi V8 for a new Hurricane engine
                    that's reportedly as much as 15% better in fuel economy. The
                    Hurricane inline-6 also creates upwards of 15% less carbon
                    dioxide, and the more robust high-output variant beats the
                    Hemi V8 in terms of both horsepower and reduction of harmful
                    emissions. For more information on this new non-Hemi
                    variant, here is

                    The US Constitution's Fifth Amendment protection against
                    self-incrimination does not prohibit police officers from
                    forcing a suspect to unlock a phone with a thumbprint scan,
                    a federal appeals court ruled yesterday. The ruling does not
                    apply to all cases in which biometrics are used to unlock an
                    electronic device but is a significant decision in an
                    unsettled area of the law.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit had to grapple
                    with the question of "whether the compelled use of Payne's
                    thumb to unlock his phone was testimonial," the
                    <a
                      href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2024/04/17/22-50262.pdf"
                      >ruling</a
                    >
                    in United States v. Jeremy Travis Payne said. "To date,
                    neither the Supreme Court nor any of our sister circuits
                    have addressed whether the compelled use of a biometric to
                    unlock an electronic device is testimonial."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A three-judge panel at the 9th Circuit ruled unanimously
                    against Payne, affirming a US District Court's denial of
                    Payne's motion to suppress evidence. Payne was a California
                    parolee who was arrested by California Highway Patrol (CHP)
                    after a 2021 traffic stop and charged with possession with
                    intent to distribute fentanyl, fluorofentanyl, and cocaine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] US District Courts applying Doe and Hubbell have
                    reached different conclusions on biometric unlocking. The
                    9th Circuit decided that the compelled use of Payne's thumb
                    "required no cognitive exertion" because it "merely provided
                    CHP with access to a source of potential information, much
                    like the consent directive in Doe. The considerations
                    regarding existence, control, and authentication that were
                    present in Hubbell are absent or, at a minimum,
                    significantly less compelling in this case. Accordingly,
                    under the current binding Supreme Court framework, the use
                    of Payne's thumb to unlock his phone was not a testimonial
                    act and the Fifth Amendment does not apply."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Yesterday's ruling from the 9th Circuit also rejected
                    Payne's argument that California Highway Patrol violated his
                    Fourth Amendment rights. The Fourth Amendment dispute
                    involved a special search condition in Payne's parole
                    "requiring him to surrender any electronic device and
                    provide a pass key or code, but not requiring him to provide
                    a biometric identifier to unlock the device," the ruling
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite that parole condition, "the search was authorized
                    under a general search condition, mandated by California
                    law, allowing the suspicionless search of any property under
                    Payne's control," the ruling said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Moreover, we hold that any ambiguity created by the
                    inclusion of the special condition, when factored into the
                    totality of the circumstances, did not increase Payne's
                    expectation of privacy in his cell phone to render the
                    search unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment," the panel
                    wrote.

                    There are several packages in Debian without a associated
                    git repository with the packaging history. This is
                    unfortunate and it would be nice if more of these would do
                    so. Quote a lot of these are without a maintainer, ie listed
                    as maintained by the '<a
                      href="https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?email=packages@qa.debian.org"
                      >Debian QA Group</a
                    >' place holder. In fact, 438 packages have this property
                    according to UDD (SELECT source FROM sources WHERE release =
                    'sid' AND (vcs_url ilike '%anonscm.debian.org%' OR
                    vcs_browser ilike '%anonscm.debian.org%' or vcs_url IS NULL
                    OR vcs_browser IS NULL) AND maintainer ilike
                    '%packages@qa.debian.org%';). Such packages can be updated
                    without much coordination by any Debian developer, as they
                    are considered orphaned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To try to improve the situation and reduce the number of
                    packages without associated git repository, I started a few
                    days ago to search out candiates and provide them with a git
                    repository under the 'debian' collaborative Salsa project. I
                    started with the packages pointing to obsolete Alioth git
                    repositories, and am now working my way across the ones
                    completely without git references. In addition to updating
                    the Vcs-* debian/control fields, I try to update
                    Standards-Version, debhelper compat level, simplify d/rules,
                    switch to Rules-Requires-Root: no and fix lintian issues
                    reported. I only implement those that are trivial to fix, to
                    avoid spending too much time on each orphaned package. So
                    far my experience is that it take aproximately 20 minutes to
                    convert a package without any git references, and a lot more
                    for packages with existing git repositories incompatible
                    with git-buildpackages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So far I have converted 10 packages, and I will keep going
                    until I run out of steam. As should be clear from the
                    numbers, there is enough packages remaining for more people
                    to do the same without stepping on each others toes. I find
                    it useful to start by searching for a git repo already on
                    salsa, as I find that some times a git repo has already been
                    created, but no new version is uploaded to Debian yet. In
                    those cases I start with the existing git repository. I
                    convert to the git-buildpackage+pristine-tar workflow, and
                    ensure a debian/gbp.conf file with "pristine-tar=True" is
                    added early, to avoid uploading a orig.tar.gz with the wrong
                    checksum by mistake. Did that three times in the begin[ning]
                    before I remembered my mistake.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, if you are a Debian Developer and got some spare time,
                    perhaps considering migrating some orphaned packages to git?

                Is anyone interested? Is the a useful way to support a distro
                that is within your capabilities? It must apply to other distros
                too. What about the one that you use?

                    An Illinois woman filed a class action lawsuit against
                    Target, accusing the retail giant of collecting and storing
                    her biometric data, including face and fingerprint scans,
                    without her consent in violation of state law.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Arnetta Dean, who filed the lawsuit with the intention of
                    preventing Target from further violating the privacy rights
                    of state residents, is also pursuing statutory damages for
                    the company's alleged collection, storage and use of
                    customers' biometric data, according to the lawsuit obtained
                    by
                    <a
                      href="https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/illinois-woman-filed-class-action-lawsuit-against-target-for-collection-biometric-data-without-consent"

                  <p>
                    The lawsuit, filed last month in Cook County, claims
                    Target's surveillance systems, including cameras with facial
                    recognition technology installed in Illinois stores,
                    "surreptitiously" collect biometric data on customers
                    without their knowledge or consent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Target does not notify customers of this fact prior to
                    store entry, nor does it obtain consent prior to collecting
                    its customers' Biometric Data," the lawsuit said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the lawsuit, Target violated the state's
                    Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by collecting,
                    storing and using biometric information without obtaining
                    written consent from customers or providing them with
                    adequate information about data retention and destruction
                    policies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    BIPA, which passed in 2008, states that companies in
                    Illinois are prohibited from collecting, storing or giving
                    out biometric data without providing notice and obtaining
                    personal consent. Companies are also required to inform
                    individuals of the specific purpose and duration of data
                    collection, and they must disclose how the information will
                    be retained and when the information will be destroyed. The
                    lawsuit says Target failed to comply with the aforementioned
                    requirements.

                    tore through the roof and two floors of a house in Naples on
                    March 8th and established that it came from a cargo pallet

                    mount the batteries on the 5,800-pound (2,630-kilogram)
                    pallet released from the space station. Made from Inconel (a

                    As such, governments and other organizations must allocate
                    resources to help secure the broader open-source ecosystem.
                    Funding for security developers has already had a tremendous
                    effect, for example, the security-focused

                    This attack is a clear example of how attackers can
                    infiltrate open-source projects by exploiting users' trust
                    to introduce backdoors. Consequently, we recommend
                    coordinating efforts from different organizations and
                    collaborating globally within the open-source ecosystem. In
                    essence, this will help ensure that open-source developers
                    are better equipped to identify such threats and mitigate
                    them promptly. Therefore, more resources, a coordinated
                    approach, knowledge sharing, and adequate funding are
                    imperative in raising

                    Arabica formed as a natural hybridization between Coffea
                    canephora and Coffea eugenioides, whereupon it received two
                    sets of chromosomes from each parent. Scientists have had a
                    hard time pinpointing exactly when—and where—this
                    allopolyploidization event took place, with estimates
                    ranging everywhere from 10,000 to 1 million years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Coffee plants have long been thought to have developed
                    in Ethiopia, but varieties that the team collected around
                    the Great Rift Valley, which stretches from Southeast Africa
                    to Asia, displayed a clear geographic split. The wild
                    varieties studied all originated from the western side,
                    while the cultivated varieties all originated from the
                    eastern side closest to the Bab al-Mandab strait that
                    separates Africa and Yemen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That would align with evidence that coffee cultivation may
                    have started principally in Yemen, around the 15th century.
                    Indian monk Baba Budan is believed to have smuggled the
                    fabled "seven seeds" out of Yemen around 1600, establishing
                    Indian Arabica cultivars and setting the stage for coffee's
                    global reach today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It looks like Yemeni coffee diversity may be the founder of
                    all of the current major varieties," Descombes says. "Coffee
                    is not a crop that has been heavily crossbred, such as maize
                    or wheat, to create new varieties. People mainly chose a
                    variety they liked and then grew it. So the varieties we
                    have today have probably been around for a long time."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Timor variety formed in Southeast Asia as a
                    spontaneous hybrid between Arabica and one of its parents,
                    Coffea canephora. Also known as Robusta and used primarily
                    for instant coffee, this species is more resistant to
                    disease than Arabica.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Thus, when Robusta hybridized itself back into Arabica on
                    Timor, it brought some of its pathogen defense genes along
                    with it," says Albert, who also co-led

                    >. Albert and collaborators' current work also presents a
                    highly improved version of the Robusta genome, as well as
                    new sequence of Arabica's other progenitor species, Coffea
                    eugenioides.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While breeders have tried replicating this crossbreeding to
                    boost pathogen defense, the new Arabica reference genome
                    allowed the present researchers to pinpoint a novel region
                    harboring members of the RPP8 resistance gene family as well
                    as a general regulator of resistance genes, CPR1.

                    "These results suggest a novel target locus for potentially
                    improving pathogen resistance in Arabica," Salojärvi says.

                    There's a reason airlines won't let you put your laptop in
                    your checked luggage; the lithium-ion battery poses a
                    serious fire hazard. But why? Lithium is incredibly
                    reactive. For instance, pure lithium violently interacts
                    with seemingly innocuous water, releasing heat and forming
                    highly flammable hydrogen. This reactivity, however, is
                    exactly why lithium makes a great material for batteries,
                    and why it is a critical mineral for the green energy
                    transition. Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in
                    electric vehicles. Plus, they can store energy produced by
                    renewable resources like solar and wind.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In recent years, lithium demand has skyrocketed. Primary
                    sources for lithium like pegmatites and volcanic clays are
                    well understood, but finding other stores that are safe and
                    economical to exploit would be helpful. To that end, a team
                    led by researchers from West Virginia University is
                    exploring whether previous industrial operations (e.g., mine
                    tailings or drill cuttings) could serve as a source of
                    additional lithium without generating new waste materials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Though the geologic literature lacked information on
                    the intersection between lithium and sulfur-rich pyrite, the
                    electrochemical and engineering world has already begun to
                    look at how lithium-sulfur batteries could replace
                    lithium-ion ones, Bhattacharya said. "I am trying to
                    understand how lithium and pyrite could be associated with
                    one another."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As it turns out, organic-rich shale may show potential for
                    higher lithium recovery as a result of that curious
                    interaction between lithium and pyrite. However, whether the
                    observations can be extrapolated beyond samples from the
                    current study site is not known.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is a well-specific study," Bhattacharya cautioned.
                    But, this work is promising because it hints at the
                    possibility that certain shales could be a lithium source
                    that doesn't require new mines. "We can talk about
                    sustainable energy without using a lot of energy resources,"
                    she said.

                    Federal prosecutors indicted a Nebraska man on charges he

                    III—45 of Omaha, Nebraska—with wire fraud, money laundering,
                    and engaging in unlawful monetary transactions in connection

                    are almost certainly Amazon Web Services and Microsoft

                    digital product passports are detailed in Chapter IX of the
                    Battery Regulation Amendment. Technical documentation on the
                    electrochemical performance and durability of the battery
                    must be provided, including details on how this data was
                    obtained. This is to ensure the batteries meet the minimum
                    requirements for battery performance and capacity in order
                    to guarantee batteries on the market are operational and

                    have different read and write permissions for the data in
                    each battery passport, so that everyone has the information

                    from President Biden, the preliminary agreement between
                    Samsung and the Department of Commerce will bring the Korean
                    firm's advanced semiconductor manufacturing and research and
                    development to Texas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The deal will result in over $40 billion in investment from
                    Samsung, cementing Texas' role in the advanced semiconductor
                    industry and creating at least 21,500 jobs. There will also
                    be up to $40 million in CHIPS funding used to train and
                    develop the local workforce.

                    Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Samsung's CHIPS money
                    will help support two new chip production facilities, a
                    research center and a packaging facility for 2.5D packaging
                    at its new site in Taylor, Texas. The first of the new fabs
                    will start making 2nm chips in 2026, according to a senior
                    US official. The second fab will also make chips based on
                    2nm and 4nm process nodes
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The money will also allow Samsung to expand its
                    semiconductor facility in Austin, Texas, about 20 miles from
                    the Taylor site.

                    by the company to build a third manufacturing plant in
                    Arizona. TSMC is also making 2nm chips, at its Arizona
                    factory, but they're not set to go into production until
                    2028. Unlike Samsung, the Taiwanese company has no plans to
                    bring advanced packaging facilities to the US.

                    touchscreens are usually not "hardened" or protected against

                    ignite, along with the firing up of the solid rocket
                    boosters. The "eight ball" indicating forces of gravity upon

                    been pulled from the App Store following controversy over
                    the unauthorized reuse of source code from a different

                    legitimate way to distribute Delta, a "sequel" to GBA4iOS
                    that emulates many classic Nintendo consoles on Apple

                    Researchers still disagree on what causes rare and large
                    "rogue waves," which can damage ships, lighthouses, and
                    other structures. Now, using combined measurements of wave
                    heights and wind speed in an oceanic region known for its
                    rough seas, a research team has demonstrated that wind can
                    produce the wave conditions expected to lead to rogue waves
                    [1]. Previously, this idea was demonstrated only in
                    laboratory experiments. The researchers hope this new
                    understanding will contribute to the development of methods
                    for predicting this dangerous phenomenon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is no consensus on what causes rogue waves in the
                    ocean, says Alessandro Toffoli, an expert in infrastructure
                    engineering at the University of Melbourne, Australia. One
                    prominent view is that oceanic rogue waves occur purely
                    through a statistical effect: although waves typically
                    follow a "normal," or Gaussian, distribution, with heights
                    strongly clustering around an average, a fortuitous
                    convergence of many such waves can occasionally produce a
                    very large wave.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In contrast, laboratory experiments and theoretical models
                    suggest that, under the right conditions, nonlinear ocean
                    dynamics can amplify waves, making the distribution of wave
                    heights depart from a Gaussian. The distribution can spread
                    out, giving large waves higher probabilities than in a
                    Gaussian distribution. Unfortunately, says Toffoli, no study
                    has yet observed such increased numbers of larger waves in
                    the ocean. "So this idea has mostly been dismissed as
                    unrealistic," he says. "Are there rogue sea states where
                    rogue waves thrive? The answer to this remains elusive."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To look for such states, Toffoli and colleagues undertook an
                    expedition in the Southern Ocean, a region around Antarctica
                    known for strong winds and large waves. The team made
                    measurements from a South African icebreaker in the austral
                    winter, in June and July 2017. During the voyage, the
                    researchers used a stereo pair of cameras to map the water
                    surface height and measure the statistical characteristics
                    of the waves viewed off one side of the ship. Alongside
                    these measurements, they collected data on local atmospheric
                    conditions, including wind speed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The team estimated the kurtosis, a statistical measure
                    of the wave size distribution's departure from a Gaussian.
                    The higher the kurtosis, the more likely are extra-large
                    waves, including rogue waves. In the wind-driven young seas,
                    with slow, strongly driven waves, the researchers found a
                    kurtosis of 3.4, well above the 3.0 value characteristic of
                    seas with a Gaussian distribution of waves. In older seas,
                    the distribution returned to a Gaussian. This observation
                    suggests that the action of strong winds during early stages
                    of wave growth can stir nonlinear ocean dynamics, leading to
                    a strongly non-Gaussian distribution of waves and more
                    frequent rogue waves.

                    I decided to try my hand at decoding these GPS signals,
                    guided by the vague end-goal of plucking out my position
                    from peanuts. I learned that the GPS signals that facilitate
                    our mapping apps are ever-present, around us at any
                    altitude, in any weather conditions, at all times.

                  <p>
                    This sounds cool in the abstract, but the tangible reality
                    is staggering. These signals are all around me as I write
                    this. They're all around you as you read it. The world is
                    soaked in these whispers, repeating themselves endlessly for
                    anyone willing to listen.

                    anywhere at any time, by learning to speak the language of
                    the electromagnetic waves flowing over your skin. These
                    waves have been a constant and quiet companion for most
                    people's entire lives.

                    of navigation data swarming around you, deafening if you
                    could just hear it. In reality, the GPS signals surrounding
                    you are astoundingly weak. To take an analogy: imagine a
                    normal light bulb, like the one that might be above you now.
                    Pull it twenty thousand kilometers away from the room you're
                    in, and have it flash, on, off, on, off, a million times a
                    second. Imagine straining your eye to watch the shimmer of
                    the bulb, two Earths away, and listen to what it's telling
                    you.

                    However, Senator Brown notes in his letter that BYD already
                    sells an electric hatchback named the "Seagull" for the
                    equivalent of less than $10,000. This compares with the
                    $28,140 that has been

                    There is also a national security twist as Senator Brown
                    claims that data collected by the sensors and cameras in
                    Chinese EVs could pose a threat. "China does not allow
                    American-made electric vehicles near their official
                    buildings. To allow their vehicles freedom to travel
                    throughout the United States would be foolish and highly
                    dangerous," he stated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Senator Brown also claims in his letter that nearly 20
                    percent of all electric vehicles sold in Europe during 2023
                    were made in China, citing this as a cautionary example.

                    After just 10 years in use, a Norwegian bridge collapsed
                    into a river and left two drivers in need of rescue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Tretten Bridge in the Øyer area of southern Norway
                    collapsed in 2022 after a heavy goods vehicle attempted to
                    cross it. Now, an inquiry into the collapse of the bridge
                    over the Gudbrandsdalslågen river has found that it failed
                    because its designers spent too long making sure it looked
                    nice and not enough time ensuring it worked as a bridge,
                    reports Dezeen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Designers of the bridge, which was opened in 2012, were
                    accused of "inadequate caution" in the development of the
                    span. As Dezeen explains:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        "The investigation has shown that inadequate caution was
                        exercised in the planning, design, inspection and
                        approval of Tretten Bridge, with respect to the risk
                        factors linked to its unconventional design," the report
                        said.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        "A short construction period, span lengths and reuse of
                        existing foundation were framework conditions for the
                        planning of the bridge," it continued.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        "These framework conditions, combined with the choice of
                        material and a strong focus on aesthetics, contributed
                        to the structure not being robust."
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    [...] During the bridge's design and build process, Norway
                    was transitioning from its own, older building regulations
                    to new European rules governing bridge design.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At this time, projects in progress were permitted to work to
                    the older regulations, and that's exactly what the team
                    behind the Tretten Bridge followed. The investigation
                    touched on this as well, stating that "all the involved
                    parties can be criticized" for their decision to work within
                    outdated frameworks.

                    has a critical vulnerability in the code that generates
                    signatures from ECDSA private keys which use the NIST P521
                    curve. (PuTTY, or Pageant, generates a signature from a key
                    when using it to authenticate you to an SSH server.)

                      >CVE-2024-31497</a
                    >. It was discovered by Fabian Bäumer and Marcus Brinkmann
                    of the Ruhr University Bochum; see their write-up
                    <a
                      href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/15/6"

                  <p>
                    The bad news: the effect of the vulnerability is to
                    <strong>compromise the private key</strong>. An attacker in
                    possession of a few dozen signed messages and the public key
                    has enough information to recover the private key, and then
                    forge signatures as if they were from you, allowing them to
                    (for instance) log in to any servers you use that key for.
                    To obtain these signatures, an attacker need only briefly
                    compromise any server you use the key to authenticate to, or
                    momentarily gain access to a copy of Pageant holding the
                    key. (However, these signatures are not exposed to passive
                    eavesdroppers of SSH connections.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Therefore, if you have a key of this type, we recommend you
                    revoke it immediately: remove the old public key from all
                    OpenSSH authorized_keys files, and the equivalent in other
                    SSH servers, so that a signature from the compromised key
                    has no value any more. Then generate a new key pair to
                    replace it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (The problem is not with how the key was originally
                    generated; it doesn't matter whether it came from PuTTYgen
                    or somewhere else. What matters is whether it was ever
                    <em>used</em> with PuTTY or Pageant.)

                    The good news: the <em>only</em> affected key type is
                    521-bit ECDSA. That is, a key that appears in Windows
                    PuTTYgen with ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 at the start of the 'Key
                    fingerprint' box, or is described as 'NIST p521' when loaded
                    into Windows Pageant, or has an id starting
                    ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 in the SSH protocol or the key file.
                    Other sizes of ECDSA, and other key algorithms, are
                    unaffected. In particular, Ed25519 is not affected.

                    In engineering, the buckling of a structure, such as a
                    bridge, often preempts its catastrophic failure. In nature,
                    however, buckling can be a positive feature, providing a
                    structure with new capabilities. For example, the buckling
                    of ridge-like structures on the wings of an ermine moth can
                    generate bursts of ultrasonic clicks that can deter
                    predators. Now scientists from the University of Bristol,
                    UK, have explained how this mechanism works. This finding
                    provides insights for bio-inspired designs of soft robots,
                    acoustics-based monitoring devices for the structural health
                    of buildings, and objects that can morph from one shape into
                    another.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moths have long been known to possess sound-based mechanisms
                    to deter predators that use echolocation to detect prey. For
                    example, a tiger moth can snap sound-producing organs
                    (tymbals) located in its thorax to create ultrasonic clicks
                    that deter bats. Ermine moths, of which there are several
                    hundred species, produce defensive sounds in a different
                    way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The tymbals of an ermine moth are in its wings. These
                    structures produce two bursts of ultrasonic clicks in each
                    wingbeat cycle—one during the upstroke and one during the
                    downstroke. The clicks have the right frequency to confuse
                    the echolocation abilities of a nearby bat, making the bat
                    think the moth is unpalatable. The clicks thus provide an
                    ermine moth with a passive acoustic defense system that
                    becomes active whenever it is in flight. "These insects
                    don't have ears, so they don't know that they're producing
                    this sound," says Marc Holderied, one of the researchers on
                    the study. "Evolution has equipped them with this fantastic
                    tool in their wings that protects them against bats, and
                    they don't even know about it."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The experiments and simulations indicate that
                    curvature changes in the hindwings during the wingbeat cycle
                    caused the tymbals to buckle sequentially. This buckling
                    excites vibrations in a neighboring region of the wing that
                    is free of scales and feathers. This excitation then
                    amplifies the vibrations, which have ultrasonic frequencies,
                    radiating them into the environment. Holderied likens the
                    process to that which occurs during a rim shot—a percussive
                    drumming technique that involves simultaneously hitting the
                    rim and the head of a drum. He says that the sequential
                    clicks are essentially a series of rim shots, which use the
                    drumhead to amplify the sounds of the rim being hit,
                    allowing them to be heard farther away.

                    Tools for customizing the Windows interface have been
                    available for decades. Some publishers, such as Stardock,
                    have even made a specialty of these applications, which
                    adjust the appearance as much as the functionality of
                    Microsoft's operating system. Whether we're talking about
                    Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 10 or Windows 11, no
                    version has escaped this customization craze. However,
                    Microsoft seems intent on annoying users of some of these
                    programs with its next update for Windows 11, 24H2.

                    will no longer work when the Windows 11 24H2 update is
                    applied. [...] According to users who have come across this
                    incompatibility,<em>ExplorerPatcher</em> 's blocking is due
                    to "<em>security and performance issues</em> ". Indeed, when
                    the application is launched on Windows 11 24H2, the system
                    returns the following message: "<em

                    [...] What's most surprising is that Microsoft has simply
                    blocked these applications via their filenames. In fact,
                    simply renaming the .exe to something else is enough to get
                    them working again without any problem. Could it be that
                    Microsoft has blocked these two applications because of real
                    problems with Windows 11 24H2? Was the blocking put in place
                    for some other reason? One thing is certain, however: while
                    Windows 11 is still struggling to establish itself,
                    particularly in the face of Windows 10, this kind of
                    "publicity" is not working in its favor.

                    Apple Inc.'s iPhone shipments slid a worse-than-projected
                    10% in the March quarter, reflecting flagging sales in China
                    despite a broader smartphone industry rebound.

                    The company shipped 50.1 million iPhones in the first three
                    months, according to market tracker IDC, falling shy of the
                    51.7 million average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg.
                    The 9.6% year-on-year drop is the steepest for Apple since
                    Covid lockdowns snarled supply chains in 2022, the
                    researchers said.

                    The Cupertino, California-based iPhone maker has struggled
                    to sustain sales in China since the debut of its latest
                    model in September. The resurgence of rivals from Huawei
                    Technologies Co. to Xiaomi Corp. and a Beijing ban on
                    foreign devices in the workplace have all weighed on sales.
                    The IDC data provides the first snapshot of the global
                    performance of Apple's most important product ahead of
                    earnings on May 2.

                    [...] The drop in iPhone shipments is significant given the
                    overall mobile market registered its best growth in years.

                    [...] Average selling prices for handsets are rising, as
                    consumers increasingly opt for premium models that they
                    intend to hold on to for longer, IDC's researchers found.
                    Apple, which consistently maintains the highest ASP in the
                    industry, has led the way in this, with consumers showing a
                    distinct preference for its higher-tier models. Still, the
                    company has this year resorted to unusual discounts to spur
                    sales, with some retail partners in China taking as much as

                Researchers have tracked muscle contractions in a bird's vocal
                tract, and reconstructed the song it was silently singing in its
                sleep. The resulting audio is a very specific call, allowing the
                team to figure out what the bird's dream was about.

                    When birds sleep, the part of their brains dedicated to
                    daytime singing remains active, showing patterns that
                    resemble those produced while awake. Researchers from the
                    University of Buenos Aires (UBA) previously demonstrated
                    that these brain patterns activate a bird's vocal muscles,
                    enabling them to silently 'replay' a song during sleep.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But, until now, it hasn't been possible to map how that
                    nocturnal activity gets processed. In their new study, the
                    UBA researchers turned the vocal muscle movements made
                    during avian dreaming into synthetic songs.

                    "Dreams are one of the most intimate and elusive parts of
                    our existence," said Gabriel Mindlin, a specialist in the
                    physical mechanisms behind birdsong and corresponding author
                    of the study. "Knowing that we share this with such a
                    distant species is very moving. And the possibility of
                    entering the mind of a dreaming bird – listening to how that
                    dream sounds – is a temptation impossible to resist."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A bird's vocal sounds are made by a unique organ only they
                    possess, the syrinx. Located at the base of the windpipe
                    (trachea), passing air causes some or all of the organ's
                    walls to vibrate, while a surrounding air sac acts like a
                    resonating chamber. The pitch of the sound produced depends
                    on the tension surrounding muscles exert on the syrinx and
                    the airways.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Custom-made electromyography (EMG) electrodes were
                    implanted in the birds to measure the muscle response and
                    electrical activity in the obliquus ventralis muscle, the
                    most prominent muscle producing the kiskadee's birdsong. EMG
                    and birdsong audio were recorded simultaneously while the
                    birds were awake and asleep. An existing dynamical systems
                    model of the kiskadee's sound production mechanism was used
                    to translate the information into synthetic songs. In basic
                    terms, a dynamical systems model breaks down what occurs in
                    the syrinx when sound is produced into a series of
                    mathematical equations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Analyzing muscular activity during sleep revealed
                    consistent activity patterns corresponding to the trills
                    produced by kiskadees during daytime territorial fights.
                    Interestingly, the 'dreaming trills' were associated with
                    raised head feathers, the same as during the daytime. The
                    researchers created a synthetic version of one of the trills
                    from the data they'd collected.

                    Highly capable hackers are rooting multiple corporate
                    networks by exploiting a maximum-severity zero-day
                    vulnerability in a firewall product from Palo Alto Networks,

                    The vulnerability, which has been under active exploitation
                    for at least two weeks now, allows the hackers with no
                    authentication to execute malicious code with root
                    privileges, the highest possible level of system access,
                    researchers said. The extent of the compromise, along with
                    the ease of exploitation, has earned the CVE-2024-3400
                    vulnerability the maximum severity rating of 10.0. The
                    ongoing attacks are the latest in a rash of attacks aimed at
                    firewalls, VPNs, and file-transfer appliances, which are
                    popular targets because of their wealth of vulnerabilities
                    and direct pipeline into the most sensitive parts of a

                    applied to their GlobalProtect interface. When that's not

                    Volexity, the security firm that discovered the zero-day

                    are "highly capable" and likely backed by a nation-state. So
                    far, only a single threat group—which Volexity tracks as
                    UTA0218—is known to be leveraging the vulnerability in
                    limited attacks. The company warned that as new groups learn
                    of the vulnerability, CVE-2024-3400, is likely to come under
                    mass exploitation, just as recent zero-days affecting

                    [...] The earliest attacks Volexity has seen took place on
                    March 26 in what company researchers suspect was UTA0218
                    testing the vulnerability by placing zero-byte files on
                    firewall devices to validate exploitability. On April 7, the
                    researchers observed the group trying unsuccessfully to
                    install a backdoor on a customer's firewall. Three days
                    later, the group's attacks were successfully deploying
                    malicious payloads. Since then, the threat group has
                    deployed custom, never-before-seen post-exploitation
                    malware. The backdoor, which is written in the Python
                    language, allows the attackers to use specially crafted
                    network requests to execute additional commands on hacked
                    devices.

                    Tesla warns owners that opening their doors or windows while
                    installing a software update could damage the vehicle, so
                    she stayed put
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the Tesla owner's manual, "Vehicle functions,
                    including some safety systems and opening or closing the
                    doors or windows, may be limited or disabled when
                    installation is in progress and you could damage the
                    vehicle." Janel chose to heed Tesla's warning and did not
                    attempt to open her doors or windows during the installation
                    process for fear of damaging her vehicle, but this seems
                    like a very dangerous oversight on Tesla's part that she was
                    able to be stuck inside at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The door mechanisms on the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y are
                    electrically operated, and under normal circumstances are
                    opened from the inside using a simple button to unlatch the
                    door. Should the vehicle have no power, these models do have
                    auxiliary manual cable release levers also found on the door
                    panel, but Tesla warns against using the manual mechanism,
                    citing that it should only be used when the car has no
                    power. Janel said she was aware of this option but didn't
                    want to risk damaging her car, and she felt confident that
                    she could stick out the heat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In contrast to Tesla's potentially dangerous warnings, Lucid
                    Motors requires all occupants to exit the vehicle before the
                    installation process begins, and the Lucid Air owners manual
                    states that owners will not be able to lock or unlock the
                    doors during an update. The Air will start a two-minute
                    countdown when an owner chooses to install an update, giving
                    them enough time to get out prior to the update beginning.

                    The sense of touch has immense importance for many aspects
                    of our life. It is the first of all the senses to develop in
                    newborns and the most direct experience of contact with our
                    physical and social environment. Complementing our own touch
                    experience, we also regularly receive touch from others
                    around us, for example, through consensual hugs, kisses or
                    massages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The recent coronavirus pandemic has raised awareness
                    regarding the need to better understand the effects that
                    touch—and its reduction during social distancing—can have on
                    our mental and physical well-being. The most common touch
                    interventions, for example, massage for adults or kangaroo
                    care for newborns, have been shown to have a wide range of
                    both mental and physical health benefits, from facilitating
                    growth and development to buffering against anxiety and
                    stress, over the lifespan of humans and animals alike. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A critical issue highlighted in the pandemic was the lack of
                    touch due to social restrictions. To accommodate the need
                    for touch in individuals with small social networks (for
                    example, institutionalized or isolated individuals), touch
                    interventions using objects/robots have been explored in the
                    past (for a review, see ref. 11). We show here that touch
                    interactions outside of the human–human domain are
                    beneficial for mental and physical health outcomes. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In conclusion, we show clear evidence that touch
                    interventions are beneficial across a large number of both
                    physical and mental health outcomes, for both healthy and
                    clinical cohorts, and for all ages. These benefits, while
                    influenced in their magnitude by study cohorts and
                    intervention characteristics, were robustly present,
                    promoting the conclusion that touch interventions can be
                    systematically employed across the population to preserve
                    and improve our health.

                    An international team of researchers led by groups from the
                    Max Planck Institute in Marburg and Phillips University in
                    Marburg has now discovered the first regular molecular
                    fractal in nature. They discovered a microbial
                    enzyme—citrate synthase from a cyanobacterium—that
                    spontaneously assembles into a regular fractal pattern known
                    as the Sierpiński triangle. This is an infinitely repeating
                    series of triangles made up of smaller triangles.

                  <p>
                    "We stumbled on this structure completely by accident and
                    almost couldn't believe what we saw when we first took
                    images of it using an electron microscope," says first
                    author Franziska Sendker.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The protein makes these beautiful triangles and as the
                    fractal grows, we see these larger and larger triangular
                    voids in the middle of them, which is totally unlike any
                    protein assembly we've ever seen before," she continues.

                    Because of Apple's restrictions, iMessage only works if you
                    have an iPhone in the mix, Migicovsky says, and will not be
                    a focus for Beeper, given the complications it saw with
                    Apple's shutdown of Beeper Mini. However, Beeper is hopeful
                    regulations could change things, pointing to the DoJ lawsuit
                    and
                    <a

                    images and videos, lack of typing indicators and encryption.

                    [...] The team expects to have feature parity across
                    platforms in a matter of months as they overhaul the iOS and
                    desktop apps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In time, they plan to add other services to Beeper as well,
                    including Google Voice, Snapchat, and Microsoft Teams.
                    Beeper also offers a widget API so developers can build on
                    top of Beeper. Plus, since Matrix is an open standard,
                    developers will be able to build alternative clients for
                    Beeper, as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The app will generate revenue via a premium subscription,
                    where the final price may be a couple of dollars per month,
                    but pricing decisions haven't yet been fully nailed down.
                    Beeper is currently free to use.
