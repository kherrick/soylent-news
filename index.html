                    KrebsOnSecurity also reported that Shelest's email address
                    was used circa 2010 by an affiliate of
                    <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=spamit">Spamit</a>,
                    a Russian-language organization that paid people to
                    aggressively promote websites hawking male enhancement drugs
                    and generic pharmaceuticals. As noted in the March 14 story,
                    this connection was confirmed by research from multiple
                    graduate students at my alma mater George Mason University.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shelest denied ever being associated with Spamit. "Between
                    2010 and 2014, we put up some web pages and optimize them —
                    a widely used SEO practice — and then ran AdSense banners on
                    them," Shelest said, presumably referring to the dozens of
                    people-search domains KrebsOnSecurity found were connected
                    to his email addresses (dmitrcox@gmail.com and
                    dmitrcox2@gmail.com). "As we progressed and learned more, we
                    saw that a lot of the inquiries coming in were for people."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The March 14 story on Onerep was the second in a
                    series of three investigative reports published here this
                    month that examined the data broker and people-search
                    industries, and highlighted the need for more congressional
                    oversight — if not regulation — on consumer data protection
                    and privacy.

                      >A Close Up Look at the Consumer Data Broker Radaris</a

                    Lyme disease, a bacterial infection transmitted by ticks,
                    affects nearly half a million people in the United States
                    every year. In most cases, antibiotics effectively clear the
                    infection, but for some patients, symptoms linger for months
                    or years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers at MIT and the University of Helsinki have now
                    discovered that human sweat contains a protein that can
                    protect against Lyme disease. They also found that about
                    one-third of the population carries a genetic variant of
                    this protein that is associated with Lyme disease in
                    genome-wide association studies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This protein may provide some protection from Lyme
                    disease, and we think there are real implications here for a
                    preventative and possibly a therapeutic based on this
                    protein," says Michal Caspi Tal, a principal research
                    scientist in MIT's Department of Biological Engineering and
                    one of the senior authors of the new study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This finding opens the door to a completely new
                    approach to preventing Lyme disease in the first place, and
                    it will be interesting to see if it could be useful for
                    preventing other types of skin infections too," says Kara
                    Spiller, a professor of biomedical innovation in the School
                    of Biomedical Engineering at Drexel University, who was not
                    involved in the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers note that people who have the protective
                    version of SCGB1D2 can still develop Lyme disease, and they
                    should not assume that they won't. One factor that may play
                    a role is whether the person happens to be sweating when
                    they're bitten by a tick carrying Borrelia burgdorferi.

                    Theories on why leafhoppers coat themselves with a
                    brochosome armor have ranged from keeping them free of
                    contaminants and water to a superhero-like invisibility
                    cloak. However, a new understanding of their geometry raises
                    a strong possibility that its main purpose could be the
                    cloak to avoid predators, according to Tak-Sing Wong,
                    professor of mechanical engineering and biomedical
                    engineering and corresponding author of the study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers have found that the size of the holes in the
                    brochosome that give it a hollow, soccer ball-like
                    appearance is extremely important. The size is consistent
                    across leafhopper species, no matter the size of the
                    insect's body. The brochosomes are roughly 600 nanometers in
                    diameter—about half the size of a single bacterium—and the
                    brochosome pores are around 200 nanometers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "That makes us ask a question," Wong said. "Why this
                    consistency? What is the secret of having brochosomes of
                    about 600 nanometers with about 200-nanometer pores? Does
                    that serve some purpose?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers found the unique design of brochosomes
                    serves a dual purpose—absorbing ultraviolet (UV) light,
                    which reduces visibility to predators with UV vision, such
                    as birds and reptiles, and scattering visible light,
                    creating an anti-reflective shield against potential
                    threats. The size of the holes is perfect for absorbing
                    light at the ultraviolet frequency.

                    that allow hackers to extract encryption keys. This issue is
                    unpatchable, which means every Mac user could be
                    compromised, but it doesn’t mean you should freak out.

                    [...] The researcher named this vulnerability
                    <a href="https://gofetch.fail/">GoFetch</a>, a
                    “microarchitectural side-channel attack that can extract
                    secret keys from constant-time cryptographic implementations
                    via data memory-dependent prefetchers (DMPs).”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They have found this issue with M1 Mac devices but found
                    that M2 and M3 CPUs also exhibit “similar exploitable DMP
                    behavior.” They have not tested with other chip variants,
                    such as M1 Max, M2 Pro, etc., but the researchers
                    hypothesize that they’re likely to be exploited as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers say that the best way to protect yourself is
                    by constantly updating your Mac to the latest version of
                    <a
                      href="https://bgr.com/guides/macos-14-sonoma-release-date-features-mac-compatibility/"

                    >. For developers of cryptographic libraries, they can
                    either set the DOIT bit and DIT bit bits, which disable the
                    DMP on some CPUs, such as M3 processors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, the best way to avoid this attack is by preventing
                    others from physically accessing your M1 Mac computer:
                    “Preventing attackers from measuring DMP activation in the
                    first place, for example, by avoiding hardware sharing, can
                    further enhance the security of cryptographic protocols.”

                    Section 230 irrelevant. Under that premise, what constitutes
                    a product under New York law is not confined to tangible
                    chattels... The Court of Appeals also emphasized the
                    following factors in determining whether an item is a
                    product:
                    <i
                      >(1) a defendant's control over the design and
                      standardization of the product, (2) the party responsible
                      for placing the product into the stream of commerce and
                      deriving a financial benefit, and (3) a party's superior
                      ability to know—and warn about—the dangers inherent in the
                      product's reasonably foreseeable uses or misuses.</i
                    ><br />...<br />Many of the social media/internet defendants
                    have attempted to establish that their platforms are mere
                    message boards and/or do not contain algorithms subjecting
                    them to the protections of the CDA and/or First Amendment.
                    This may ultimately prove true. In addition, some defendants
                    may yet establish that their platforms are not products or
                    that the negligent design features plaintiffs have alleged
                    are not part of their platforms. However, at this stage of
                    the litigation the Court must base its ruling on the
                    allegations of the complaint and not "facts" asserted by the
                    defendants in their briefs or during oral argument and those
                    allegations allege viable causes of action under a products
                    liability theory.

                  <p>
                    [...] This week, a group of white hat hackers released the
                    research from an in-depth study into a particular set of
                    security vulnerabilities — known as "Unsaflok," named after
                    the Dormakaba-branded Saflok door locks that they target.
                    The study that resulted in Unsaflok's discovery was
                    originally conducted in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2022; a city
                    that has seen its fair share of brutal cyberattacks like the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.slashgear.com/1391747/mgm-casino-cyberattack-slot-machines-atm-shut-down/"
                      >2022 MGM casino hack</a
                    >. The vulnerability the researchers discovered is equal
                    parts dangerous and simple: All it takes is a couple of
                    quick taps with an ordinary card key, and anyone could
                    theoretically break into a hotel room.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Saflok locking systems are installed on hotel rooms all over
                    the world; with around 3 million doors in 13,000 properties
                    across 131 countries estimated to have doors installed
                    according to the researchers'
                    <a href="https://unsaflok.com/">disclosed information</a>.
                    Even though all of these doors are in different locations
                    and under different owners, this single exploit could take
                    advantage of every one of them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The vulnerability revolves around the RFID keycards that the
                    Saflok system reads, which utilize a system called MIFARE
                    Classic. If a hacker were to obtain any two MIFARE keycards,
                    even just from renting out a couple of rooms in a hotel
                    themselves, they could then use a generic RFID read-write
                    device to instantly alter their contents. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The bad news is that, due to the complexity of the
                    systems involved in managing hotel door locks, the process
                    has been slow-going. In addition to individually updating
                    the software in every single lock, all of the relevant
                    keycards need to be reissued, and the front desk management
                    software needs to be overhauled. As of March 2024, only
                    around 36% of the affected Saflok systems have been replaced
                    or updated, according to the researchers' report.

                    After winning the IOCCC for the first time, I had the idea
                    of writing an emulator of the 8080 processor in 2000
                    characters of C, after patterning experimentally the more
                    than 200 instructions and doing measures of byte count, I
                    realized that it was possible and I made it. Then I added
                    CP/M support as a extra feature. I was completely astonished
                    when I won Best of Show of 19th IOCCC :).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This emulator was developed eighteen years ago when
                    the computers had 32-bit processors and it used a hole in
                    the C language syntax where you could pass a pointer on an
                    integer. In fact, this is the IOCCC objective: make C
                    compilers to do things these shouldn't be supposed to do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the C compilers for 64-bit processors don't allow
                    it any more as pointers are 64-bit and the int types are
                    32-bit, so compilers stop with an error (especially in macOS
                    because clang).

                    • Seven case studies of sponsorship deals with major
                    polluters are presented. Secrecy is a barrier to knowing the
                    size of many sponsorship deals. But one multi- million euro,
                    publicly reported deal between the International Ski &amp;
                    Snowboard Federation (FIS) with car maker Audi we calculate
                    will generate between 103,000–144,000 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>e
                    (equivalent to burning between 238,000 and 333,000 barrels
                    of oil ).³
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    • In the other cases, and based on reasonable estimates,
                    named companies' sponsorship deals with snowsport
                    organisations are estimated to generate between 11,500 and
                    192,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>e each.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    • The report concludes that winter sports athletes,
                    organisations and event organisers must take responsibility,
                    end polluting sponsorships, and stop winter sports being
                    used as a billboard by companies whose activities are
                    destroying the sports' future.

                Tobacco analogies are made. The report ends with a call to cease
                sponsorship deals with companies that are major drivers of
                climate change, pointing in particular at oil and gas companies,
                manufacturers of fossil-fueled cars, and airlines.

                A lot of places have already had to shorten or even move their
                winter sports seasons due to lack of once-abundant snow.

                    animation toolchain and Nanite, Epic's ambitious polygon
                    rendering system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Amy Hennig, known for her work on the Uncharted series,
                    demonstrated the developments by revealing her studio's new
                    game – 1943: Rise of Hydra. Planned for a 2025 release, the
                    title stars Captain America and Black Panther in occupied
                    Paris during World War II.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the game's unveiling, which starts around the
                    19-minute mark in the video below, didn't include gameplay,
                    Hennig proved that the trailer was running in real-time by
                    exploring its scenes and characters using the Unreal Engine
                    editor. The developers took the opportunity to showcase the
                    newly introduced Nanite tessellation, which adds detail to
                    objects without rendering additional polygons. They also
                    demonstrated systems that can quickly change environmental
                    textures and cast realistic shadows on smoke or fog.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, Hennig explained how Unreal Engine 5's motion
                    capture system combines with its advanced MetaHuman
                    character creator to allow realistic facial animations
                    recorded from live actors. Version 5.4's primary addition to
                    animation is Motion Matching, which blends positions to
                    animate in-game characters efficiently. Fortnite has been
                    exhibiting the system since the launch of Chapter 5, and
                    Epic used the GDC presentation to announce significant
                    additions to the game's custom creation tools.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                Why was Michael David Crawford different? - well, he wasn't. In
                many ways he was just like many of us. By profession he was a
                software engineer. He wrote software for OSX. He first became
                well known - or reasonably so in our circles - for being on
                Kuro5hin. However, he was certainly different from many of us
                for the physical and mental health, and social problems that he
                experienced. Despite all of these things though he remained
                polite and open to having an interesting discussion on any
                technical issue that arose, both on Kuro5hin and subsequently
                here on SN. Someone who knew him far better than I did wrote
                about him

                justice. He was a 'nice guy' and intelligent too.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, in 2010 he was
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhLV7jydPJ8"
                  >interviewed on CNN </a
                >discussing employment problems that were being experienced by
                software engineers at that time. But this youtube link was not
                his only 'appearance' on that site. For some reason he thought
                others might
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn7waB7rOf4"
                  >want to hear him sing</a
                >
                and elsewhere he thought that we all ought to know that
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dGTmjUXH0Q"
                  >he invented the internet</a
                >. That last link perhaps shows the battle that he was having
                with mental problems yet here on this site he remained the same
                old 'MDC' that we had known since the start of SN and even
                before then for some of us.

                    Remember him. A good person, sometimes bewildered at the
                    senseless cruelty of others, and at his best, indignant and
                    retributive against those cruelties. Not a Vigilante, just a
                    human who wanted children to be safe. Smart but too much of
                    a misfit for society to let him live happily and
                    productively for very long at a stretch.

                    The research review, known as the PlastChem report, was
                    released on Thursday and comes ahead of the next round of
                    negotiations for a

                    Researchers, who spent a year combing through research
                    reports, sorted chemicals used in plastics based on their
                    environmental and health effects – information the team
                    hopes will inform governmental regulations and
                    <a

                    to curb plastic use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The review found that there are more plastic chemicals than
                    previously known, and 4,200 (26 per cent) of these
                    compounds, including those used as raw ingredients,
                    stabilisers and colourants, are of concern due to their
                    "persistent, bioaccumulative, mobile and/or toxic" nature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] More than 400 of the chemicals identified in the
                    report are in every major commonly used plastic product such
                    as food packaging, and all the tested plastics leached
                    hazardous chemicals into the environment, researchers noted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While about 1,000 plastic chemicals are regulated by
                    global treaties such as the Stockholm Convention on
                    Persistent Organic Pollutants, thousands more are not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The PlastChem report is a wake-up call to
                    policymakers and industry. We need more transparency and
                    better management of chemicals of concern in plastic," Hans
                    Peter Arp, a co-author of the report from the Norwegian
                    University of Science and Technology (NTNU), said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The future of innovation in plastic should focus on safety,
                    sustainability, and necessity, rather than just
                    functionality," Dr Arp said.

                    also unusual for a traditional venture-based startup to have
                    repurchase rights for vested shares that are unrelated to a

                    These terms "keep everyone under their control, even if they

                    employees don't want to be forced to return their valuable
                    SpaceX stock for no compensation. "And since there is no
                    urgency by SpaceX to go public, being banned from tender
                    offers effectively zeros out your shares, at least for a
                    long time. Even though you paid thousands to cover the

                    The new biography Steve Jobs contains a remarkable claim
                    about the power supply of the Apple II and its designer Rod
                    Holt:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        Instead of a conventional linear power supply, Holt
                        built one like those used in oscilloscopes. It switched
                        the power on and off not sixty times per second, but
                        thousands of times; this allowed it to store the power
                        for far less time, and thus throw off less heat. "That
                        switching power supply was as revolutionary as the Apple
                        II logic board was," Jobs later said. "Rod doesn't get a
                        lot of credit for this in the history books but he
                        should. Every computer now uses switching power
                        supplies, and they all rip off Rod Holt's design."
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                    I found it amazing to think that computers now use power
                    supplies based on the Apple II's design, so I did some
                    investigation. It turns out that Apple's power supply was
                    not revolutionary, either in the concept of using a
                    switching power supply for computers or in the specific
                    design of the power supply. Modern computer power supplies
                    are totally different and do not rip off anything from Rod
                    Holt's design. It turns out that Steve Jobs was making his
                    customary claim that everyone is stealing Apple's
                    revolutionary technology, entirely contrary to the facts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The history of switching power supplies turns out to be
                    pretty interesting. While most people view the power supply
                    as a boring metal box, there's actually a lot of
                    technological development behind it. There was, in fact, a
                    revolution in power supplies in the late 1960s through the
                    mid 1970s as switching power supplies took over from simple
                    but inefficient linear power supplies, but this was a few
                    years before the Apple II came out in 1977. The credit for
                    this revolution should go to advances in semiconductor
                    technology, specifically improvements in switching
                    transistors, and then innovative ICs to control switching
                    power supplies.

                  There is little evidence that partial automation has any
                  safety benefits, so it's essential that these systems can only
                  be used when proven safety features are engaged. These include
                  seat belts, AEB and lane departure prevention. For a good
                  rating in this category, a partial automation system should
                  not switch on if the driver is unbelted or AEB or lane
                  departure prevention is not active. If already in operation
                  and the driver unfastens their seat belt, the system should
                  immediately begin its multi-mode, driver-disengagement
                  attention reminders. Finally, it must be impossible to switch
                  off AEB or lane departure prevention if the automation is
                  engaged.
                  <p>
                    The hands-free ProPILOT Assist 2.0, Lexus Teammate, and GM
                    Super Cruise systems are the only ones that meet all these
                    requirements. The hands-on ProPILOT Assist with Navi-link
                    and the BMW system come close, but each deactivates without
                    issuing an alert when a key safety feature is disengaged.
                    This is dangerous because the driver may not be aware that
                    they need to resume full control of the vehicle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In contrast, most of the systems fail multiple safety
                    feature requirements. Volvo Pilot Assist, for example,
                    deactivates without an alert when the driver unbuckles, can
                    be activated with lane departure prevention turned off and
                    also remains active if the feature is switched off
                    mid-drive. The two Genesis systems fail all safety feature
                    requirements.

                    In 2019, astronomers discovered a group of white dwarfs that
                    mysteriously stopped cooling. These "forever-young" stars
                    remain at a near-constant surface temperature for at least
                    eight billion years—an incredible length of time,
                    considering the universe is 13.8 billion years old.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Something is fueling these stars from within, but given that
                    they had run out of their nuclear fuel source, scientists
                    were unsure what could be keeping them shining so brightly.
                    Our research, recently published in Nature, presents the
                    solution to this conundrum.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using information gathered by the Gaia space observatory of
                    the European Space Agency, researchers discovered that some
                    white dwarfs essentially stop cooling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By studying how white dwarfs are distributed as a function
                    of temperature (from hot to cold) in the Gaia data,
                    astronomers noticed an accumulation of white dwarfs at
                    intermediate temperatures. This indicates that some white
                    dwarfs spend more time at these intermediate
                    temperatures—eight billion years more than thought possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    White dwarfs are weird. A mere teaspoon of material from
                    their cores weighs several tons. Under such extreme
                    densities, matter can behave strangely. Even though the
                    interiors of white dwarfs are millions of degrees hot, the
                    density is high enough that they can freeze into a solid
                    state. They form crystals out of the carbon, oxygen and
                    other elements present in their interiors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The formation of these crystals normally starts at the
                    center of the star, where density is highest. As the white
                    dwarf cools down, more crystals are formed in successive
                    layers until almost the whole star is completely solid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, this inside-out crystallization does not apply to
                    all white dwarfs. We discovered that the heaviest elements
                    present in white dwarfs are expelled from the crystals as
                    they are formed, just as salt is expelled from ice crystals
                    when seawater freezes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The crystals become less dense than their surroundings, and
                    float up like ice cubes in a glass of water. As the crystals
                    do not stay in place, the core cannot simply freeze from the
                    inside out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The movements created by the floating crystals reshuffle the
                    chemical layering inside the star. Gradually, the heaviest
                    elements are transported toward the center. This releases a
                    steady flow of gravitational energy that keeps the star
                    shining at a near-constant temperature for billions of
                    years.

                    I had to create scans of a small flex PCB to capture more
                    details than a flat scanner could give me. Of course, this
                    task turned out harder than I imagined. I already had a good
                    camera, but I was lacking a good macro lens. Buying one
                    turned out to be hard because the highest magnification
                    ratios on most macro lenses are 1:1. The better ones are, of
                    course, pricier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After browsing some extreme macrophotography forums, I
                    discovered that some people use microscope objectives with
                    their cameras.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those microscope objectives are divided into two groups:
                    infinity-corrected and non-infinity-corrected. What does
                    this mean? The non-infinity-corrected objective focuses the
                    captured image on a plane some distance after the objective.
                    The infinity-corrected objective collimates the captured
                    light into a parallel beam. The second type is useful if you
                    need to Fourier transform the image by transparency masks or
                    do other fancy scientific image transformations. Filtering
                    light is easier if you work with a parallel beam. To use
                    this type of objective in macrophotography, you need an
                    additional lens to focus the parallel beam to an image on
                    the sensor plane.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first type of microscope objective can be used directly
                    with your interchangeable lens camera. The only thing you
                    need is an extension tube, which can be 3D printed in an
                    hour. I found a great Thingiverse repository that contains
                    extension tubes for microscopic objectives with various
                    camera mounts. Together with the cheapest 4X
                    non-infinity-corrected, achromatic microscope objective
                    gives decent results.

                Herb Sutter has an interesting article on his blog about
                approaches to improve security in C++ and modifying the language
                to assist with stopping programming errors that lead to
                exploits.

                There are two interesting insights. Firstly. most CVEs come from
                issues that could be dealt with with small changes to C++ that
                are being proposed.<br />The second is that even coding in
                languages with automatic memory allocation can still have
                massive vulnerabilties. Even code written in Rust has
                vulnerabilities so the language alone is not the whole problem.

                    tl;dr: I don't want C++ to limit what I can express
                    efficiently. I just want C++ to let me enforce our
                    already-well-known safety rules and best practices by
                    default, and make me opt out explicitly if that's what I
                    want. Then I can still use fully modern C++... just nicer.

                    The first flying taxi could take off in the UK by 2026 and
                    become a regular sight in our skies two years later, if a
                    government announcement goes to plan. The Future of Flight
                    action plan, developed with the aerospace industry, also
                    says drones and other flying vehicles will become more
                    autonomous. It predicts that the first pilotless flying taxi
                    will take off in 2030.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But experts say hurdles such as infrastructure and public
                    acceptance need to be overcome first.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are a number of different models, but most flying
                    taxis look like a futuristic helicopter and can usually
                    carry about five people. They are part of a family of
                    vehicles called "eVTOLs" - which stands for electric
                    vertical take-off and landing aircraft. The technology for
                    them exists now, but it is likely that the aircraft will
                    start off as exclusive modes of transport - replacing
                    expensive journeys currently done by helicopters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Department for Transport also plans to allow drones to
                    fly beyond visual line of sight - meaning the person
                    controlling the drone cannot see it in the air. Some of the
                    uses of unmanned drones include transporting medical
                    supplies, delivering post in rural areas and tracking down
                    criminals on the run. Their use is still in early stages,
                    but the plan suggests drone deliveries would be commonplace
                    by 2027.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The biggest obstacles to getting flying taxis into the air
                    are infrastructure and public perception, says Craig
                    Roberts, head of drones, at consultancy firm PwC.

                    [...] No other mini airports have been built or trialled
                    since the demonstration two years ago. But according to the
                    government plan, the first vertiport (airport for vertical
                    vehicles) will be operational this year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The UK's aerospace regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority,
                    is consulting on proposals for vertiports at existing
                    aerodromes. New regulation would almost certainly need to be
                    created if the government's aim of bringing in autonomous
                    air taxis by 2030 is to be met.

                    Vegetation plays a vital role in regulating the percentage
                    of precipitation reaching the ground to nourish the root
                    systems of plants both in the canopy and undergrowth, which
                    consequently supports the survival of the entire forest
                    ecosystem. Water arrives to the ground via multiple
                    mechanisms, including throughfall (water falling directly
                    through the canopy) or stemflow (water flowing down stems
                    and trunks), while some is intercepted by the canopy leaves
                    and does not reach ground level.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    New research, published in Water Resources Research, has
                    focused on pour points, locations where water flowing under
                    the branches detach. These are distinguished from the large
                    drops falling from leaves, known as drip points.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A pour point is formed when the raindrops, initially
                    intercepted by leaves or the top half of the branch, flow to
                    the underside of branches, coalesce with other droplets to
                    form a rivulet, but fall before becoming a part of stemflow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The detachment of the rivulet can occur where multiple
                    branches converge or where a single branch changes in angle,
                    leading to a pour point. These are important as they
                    considerably increase water received from the canopy to the
                    forest floor at fixed points, thereby supporting enhanced
                    infiltration of water to the ground.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The volume of water received at pour points is impacted by a
                    number of factors, such as the structure of the branches,
                    leaf surface area (foliation), and the volume of rainfall.
                    The larger water droplets occurring at these points have
                    more kinetic energy than normal rainfall, meaning that they
                    create more pronounced dips in the soil upon impact, thus
                    augmenting infiltration efficiency.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Measuring the water content of soil directly below
                    pour points, the research team found 20%–30% of the seasonal
                    rainfall volume infiltrated to a depth of 1 m here, compared
                    to just 5% in control test areas away from pour points. This
                    makes pour points important zones for groundwater recharge
                    and storage in the forest ecosystem, although in the study
                    site one pour point was identified per ~30 m2, matching the
                    distribution of banksia trees, being one pour point per tree
                    on average.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This particular study site in Western Australia is important
                    as it overlies a significant source of groundwater that
                    supplies the population of Perth. Therefore, the ability of
                    pour points to potentially recharge groundwater supplies at
                    this site (and at others via other trees globally), is vital
                    for supporting water resources management both for forests
                    and humanity.

              <p>Just a brief update - but welcome news for a change.</p>
              <p>
                After a long wait (and after a query to the IRS regarding the
                progress of our application), fliptop has received news verbally
                that we have been <b>approved</b> by the IRS for Not For Profit
                status. The essential paperwork should be with fliptop by the
                end of the week. Once it has been received we can then move
                ahead to create a company. Again, we cannot guess how long this
                process will take but it is the final step required before the
                community can take control of the site and its assets.

                    organization," said Chuck Robbins, Cisco's chair and CEO, in

                    Networking giant Cisco acquired digital infrastructure
                    company Splunk and says the merger will allow them to
                    "supercharge" and revolutionize the way it wields artificial
                    intelligence for its customers<strong>.</strong>

                  <p>
                    Cisco announced plans to acquire software company Splunk in
                    September 2023 and announced the completion of the deal on
                    Monday in a press release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The acquisition of Splunk now makes Cisco one of the largest
                    software companies in the world, Cisco said in the release.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We will revolutionize the way our customers leverage data
                    to connect and protect every aspect of their organization as
                    we help power and protect the AI revolution," Cisco CEO
                    Chuck Robbins said in a statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Cisco acquired Splunk for roughly $28 billion, or
                    about $157 per share in cash, the companies said. Combined,
                    Cisco and Splunk "can create new profitable revenue
                    streams," they said.

                    To bolster weight-bearing capacity, many researchers have
                    attempted to thicken their paper-thin designs in varying
                    spots. U-M's team, however, found that uniformity is key.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "What happens is you add one level of thickness here, and a
                    different level of thickness there, and it becomes
                    mismatched," Filipov said. "So when the load is carried
                    through these components, it starts to cause bending.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "That uniformity of the component's thickness is what's key
                    and what's missing from many current origami systems. When
                    you have that, together with appropriate locking devices,
                    the weight placed upon a structure can be evenly transferred
                    throughout."

                    In the attack, hackers create an app that injects malicious
                    code into the Meta Quest VR system and then launch a clone
                    of the VR system's home screen and apps that looks identical
                    to the user's original screen. Once inside, attackers can
                    see, record, and modify everything the person does with the

                    browsing activity, and even the user's social interactions.
                    The attacker can even change the content of a user's

                  <p>
                    A spokesperson for Meta said the company plans to review the
                    findings: "We constantly work with academic researchers as
                    part of our bug bounty program and other initiatives."

                    VR headsets have slowly become more popular in recent years,
                    but security research has lagged behind product development,
                    and current defenses against attacks in VR are lacking.
                    What's more, the immersive nature of virtual reality makes
                    it harder for people to realize they've fallen into a trap.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The shock in this is how fragile the VR systems of today
                    are," says Heather Zheng, a professor of computer science at
                    the University of Chicago, who led the team behind the
                    research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The inception attack exploits a loophole in Meta Quest
                    headsets: users must enable "developer mode" to download
                    third-party apps, adjust their headset resolution, or
                    screenshot content, but this mode allows attackers to gain
                    access to the VR headset if they're using the same Wi-Fi
                    network.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Developer mode is supposed to give people remote access for
                    debugging purposes. However, that access can be repurposed
                    by a malicious actor to see what a user's home screen looks
                    like and which apps are installed. (Attackers can also
                    strike if they are able to access a headset physically or if
                    a user downloads apps that include malware.) With this
                    information, the attacker can replicate the victim's home
                    screen and applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then the attacker stealthily injects an app with the
                    inception attack in it. The attack is activated and the VR
                    headset hijacked when unsuspecting users exit an application
                    and return to the home screen. The attack also captures the
                    user's display and audio stream, which can be livestreamed
                    back to the attacker.

                    If you're a PC hardware geek who's been dreaming of a laptop
                    that you can upgrade far beyond the life cycle of a typical
                    machine, Framework's modular notebooks must seem like a
                    miracle. The American company has a straightforward pitch:
                    What if your laptop could be nearly as customizable as a
                    desktop, with the ability to swap components out for repairs
                    and upgrades? What if we could put an end to disposable
                    hardware? We were intrigued by Framework's original 13-inch
                    notebook and its Chromebook variant, despite some rough
                    edges and a basic design. Now, with the Framework Laptop 16,
                    the company is targeting the most demanding and (arguably)
                    hardest group of PC users to please: Gamers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Framework has already proved it can build compelling modular
                    laptops, but can the Laptop 16 cram in powerful graphics, a
                    fast display and other components to keep up with the likes
                    of Alienware, Razer and ASUS? Sort of, it turns out — and
                    there are plenty of other tradeoffs for living the modular
                    laptop dream. Hardware quirks abound, battery life is
                    mediocre and it still looks like a totally generic machine.
                    But how many other notebooks could let you completely
                    upgrade your CPU or GPU in a few years? Who else offers a
                    customizable keyboard setup? In those respects, the
                    Framework 16 stands alone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] I was genuinely bummed to discover that it was a
                    fairly mediocre gaming machine, at least for its high price.

                    According to UNESCO, intangible cultural heritage refers to
                    mainly cultural forms of expression, which are directly
                    linked to human creativity and traditions, and which people
                    pass those on through generations and are constantly
                    evolving.

                    This includes practices, rituals, knowledge, skills and
                    performing arts such as music, dance and theater, which are

                    Techno is a fundamental part of the city, according to Peter
                    Kirn, a Berlin-based DJ and music producer. In 2021 he told
                    the Observer: "In other cities, people wouldn't accept music
                    that's really hard or weird and full of synthesisers and
                    really brutal, distorted drum machines. You can't play that
                    at peak hour in a club, let alone over lunch. And here it's
                    totally acceptable to play that over lunch.

                    Over the course of the 1980s, the Berlin club scene
                    developed into one of the world's leading centres of the

                    The electronic music genre in particular became a kind of

                    in 1991, and the annual Love Parade.

                    Lyme disease is a fast-growing problem in the United States,
                    where approximately 476,000 people are diagnosed and treated
                    for it each year, according to the

                    from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That
                    number is likely an overestimate, because many patients are
                    treated after a tick bite even if an infection isn't

                    The No. 1 rule listed on the Suyu Discord is that "piracy is
                    prohibited." That includes any talk about downloading games
                    or "asking for system files, ROMs, encryption keys, shader

                    According to a report from Reuters, SpaceX has been
                    contracted by the Department of Defense's National
                    Reconnaissance Office (NRO) to build a network of hundreds
                    of low-orbiting spy satellites capable of operating as a

                    SpaceX has been contracted by the Department of Defense's
                    National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) to build a network of
                    hundreds of low-orbiting spy satellites capable of operating
                    as a swarm and tracking targets on the ground, according to
                    Reuters. The Reuters report, which cites five sources with
                    knowledge of the program, builds on earlier reporting by The
                    Wall Street Journal that revealed SpaceX had signed a $1.8
                    billion contract in 2021 with an unnamed agency.

                    This network, called Starshield, would reportedly be able to
                    gather continuous imagery all over Earth for US
                    intelligence, using a mix of large imaging satellites to
                    collect data and relay satellites to transmit information.
                    According to one source who spoke to Reuters, it has the
                    potential to make it so "no one can hide." Neither SpaceX
                    nor the NRO directly confirmed the company's involvement in
                    the project, but an NRO spokesperson told Reuters, "The
                    National Reconnaissance Office is developing the most
                    capable, diverse, and resilient space-based intelligence,
                    surveillance, and reconnaissance system the world has ever
                    seen."

                    The FCC has raised the speeds required to describe internet
                    service as "broadband" for the first time since 2015. The
                    agency's annual high-speed internet assessment concluded
                    that 100 Mbps downloads and 20 Mbps uploads will be the new
                    standard. The news will likely irk ISPs who would love to
                    keep pointing to 25 Mbps / 3 Mbps speeds (the previous
                    standards) and convincing people they're getting high-speed
                    broadband.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] More specifically, the agency said fixed terrestrial
                    broadband service (not including satellite) has yet to be
                    deployed to around 24 million Americans, including about 28
                    percent of people in rural areas and over 23 percent of
                    those living on Tribal lands. On the mobile front, it added
                    that about nine percent of Americans (including 36 percent
                    in rural areas and over 20 percent on Tribal lands) lack
                    adequate 5G cellular speeds of at least 35 Mbps down / 3
                    Mbps up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The FCC can't police ISPs to force them to boost their
                    speeds, but this type of move may be the best card it can
                    play. What it can do is prevent them from marketing their
                    services as "broadband" internet if they don't meet these
                    thresholds. It remains to be seen whether the companies
                    providing the infrastructure play ball or opt for other
                    marketing buzzwords to sell customers on glacial and
                    outdated internet speeds.

                    Many devices have been made difficult or financially
                    nonviable to repair, whether by design or because of a lack
                    of parts, manuals, or specialty tools. Machines that make
                    ice cream, however, seem to have a special place in the

                    The Federal Trade Commission and the antitrust division of

                    anti-circumvention rules of Section 1201 of the Digital
                    Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The governing bodies also
                    submitted proprietary diagnostic kits, programmable logic
                    controllers, and enterprise IT devices for DMCA exemptions.

                    "In each case, an exemption would give users more choices

                    and industrial equipment," the joint comment states. Those
                    markets would also see greater competition in the repair
                    market, and companies would be prevented from using DMCA
                    laws to enforce monopolies on repair, according to the
                    comment.

                    [...] Every three years, the Copyright Office allows for
                    petitions to exempt certain exceptions to DMCA violations
                    (and renew prior exemptions). Repair advocates have won
                    exemptions for farm equipment repair, video game consoles,
                    cars, and certain medical gear. The exemption is often
                    granted for device fixing if a repair person can work past
                    its locks, but not for the distribution of tools that would
                    make such a repair far easier. The esoteric nature of such
                    "release valve" offerings has led groups like the EFF to
                    push for the DMCA's abolishment.

                      Researchers have found a new way to simplify the structure
                      of high-efficiency blue organic light-emitting diodes
                      (OLEDs), which could lead to longer-lasting and higher
                      definition television screens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      OLEDs are a class of organic electronics that are already
                      found commercially in smartphones and displays and can be
                      more efficient than competing technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Although OLED television screens have vivid picture
                      quality, they also have drawbacks such as high cost and
                      comparatively short lifespans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      [...] An OLED is built like a sandwich, with organic
                      semiconductor layers between two electrodes. In the middle
                      of the stack is the emissive layer, which lights up when
                      powered with electricity. Electrical energy goes into the
                      molecules, which then release this extra energy as light.

                    Uber and Lyft say they're ending services in Minneapolis
                    over a city-mandated driver pay increase. The city council
                    pushed through the measure to bring driver pay closer to the
                    local minimum wage of $15.57 an hour.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] However, Uber and Lyft say they'll end services in the
                    city before the pay rise takes effect on May 1. Lyft says
                    the increase is "deeply flawed," citing a Minnesota study
                    indicating that drivers could meet the minimum wage and
                    still cover health insurance, paid leave and retirement
                    savings at lower rates of $1.21 per mile and 49 cents per
                    minute. "We support a minimum earning standard for drivers,
                    but it should be done in an honest way that keeps the
                    service affordable for riders," spokesperson CJ Macklin told
                    The Verge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An Uber spokesperson told the publication that the company
                    was disappointed by the council's choice to "ignore the data
                    and kick Uber out of the Twin Cities," putting around 10,000
                    drivers out of work. They noted Uber's confidence that by
                    working with drivers, drivers and legislators, "we can
                    achieve comprehensive statewide legislation that guarantees
                    drivers a fair minimum wage, protects their independence and
                    keeps rideshare affordable."

                    The Ubuntu-based distro currently includes
                    <em>Hexchat</em> in its default software set.
                    <em>IRC</em> isn't as trendy as <em>Discord</em> or
                    <em>Telegram</em> but it is a free, open standard that no
                    single entity controls, is relatively low-bandwidth,
                    interoperable, and efficient.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But as I reported in February:
                    <a
                      href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2024/02/hexchat-irc-client-final-release"
                      ><em>Hexchat</em> is no more.</a
                    >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>Hexchat</em> quitting the chat leaves —I so badly want
                    to type <em>leafs</em> there— Linux Mint with a dilemma and
                    an opportunity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The <em>dilemma</em> being: "should we continue shipping an
                    IRC client, and what role does it serve?" and the
                    <em>opportunity</em> being: "could we replace it with
                    something better?".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Ever wondered <em>why</em> Linux Mint comes with an
                    IRC client preinstalled? It's mainly to offer a way for
                    users of the distro to talk to, ask questions, and get
                    support from other users of the distro in (relative) real
                    time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Since its official IRC channels remain active, with
                    users and developers using them daily to answer questions,
                    offer support, and connect over a shared interest, should
                    the demise of <em>Hexchat</em> have to mean moating of IRC
                    entirely?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As is, IRC isn't user-friendly. It's a kind of an arcane
                    magic involving strange commands. Its onboarding is obtuse.
                    And the protocol doesn't natively support things like media
                    sharing (screenshots are useful when troubleshooting),
                    clickable links, or other modern "niceties".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And yet, IRC is a fast, established, open, and versatile
                    protocol. It's not as flashy as <em>Discord</em> but it's
                    not encumbered by superfluous social excesses or corporate
                    caveats. It's free and immediate (no sign-up required to use
                    it) which makes it ideal for 'when you need it' use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So work has begun on a new dedicated "chat room" app to
                    replace <em>Hexchat</em>, called <em>Jargonaut</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Linux Mint's goal is not to build a fully-featured IRC
                    client, or even an IRC client at all. Jargonaut is a chat
                    app that just happens to use IRC as its underlying chat
                    protocol.

                    Is there a way to stick hard and soft materials together
                    without any tape, glue or epoxy? A new study
                    <a

                    in <em>ACS Central Science</em> shows that applying a small
                    voltage to certain objects forms chemical bonds that
                    securely link the objects together. Reversing the direction
                    of electron flow easily separates the two materials. This
                    electroadhesion effect could help create biohybrid robots,
                    improve biomedical implants and enable new battery
                    technologies.

                    When an adhesive is used to attach two things, it binds the
                    surfaces either through mechanical or electrostatic forces.
                    But sometimes those attractions or bonds are difficult, if
                    not impossible, to undo. As an alternative, reversible
                    adhesion methods are being explored, including
                    electroadhesion (EA).
                  </p>

                    Though the term is used to describe a few different
                    phenomena, one definition involves running an electric
                    current through two materials causing them to stick
                    together, thanks to attractions or chemical bonds.
                    Previously, Srinivasa Raghavan and colleagues
                    <a
                      href="https://phys.org/news/2023-05-gluing-soft-materials.html"
                      >demonstrated that EA can hold soft, oppositely charged
                      materials together</a
                    >, and even be used to build simple structures. This time,
                    they wanted to see if EA could reversibly bind a hard
                    material, such as graphite, to a soft material, such as
                    animal tissue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For EA to occur, the authors found that the hard
                    material needs to conduct electrons, and the soft material
                    needs to contain salt ions They hypothesize that the
                    adhesion arises from chemical bonds that form between the
                    surfaces after an exchange of electrons. This may explain
                    why some metals that hold onto their electrons strongly,
                    including titanium, and some fruits that contain more sugar
                    than salts, including grapes, failed to adhere in some
                    situations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A final experiment showed that EA can occur completely
                    underwater, revealing an even wider range of possible
                    applications. The team says that this work could help create
                    new batteries, enable biohybrid robotics, enhance biomedical
                    implants and much more.

                    is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that's been active since
                    2004 and gathers sensitive information, such as hostname and
                    IP address, from a compromised system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There has been a worrying spike in Bifrost Linux variants
                    during the past few months: Palo Alto Networks has detected
                    more than 100 instances of Bifrost samples, which "raises
                    concerns among security experts and organizations,"
                    researchers Anmol Murya and Siddharth Sharma wrote in the
                    company's newly published findings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moreover, there is evidence that cyberattackers aim to
                    expand Bifrost's attack surface even further, using a
                    malicious IP address associated with a Linux variant hosting
                    an ARM version of Bifrost as well, they said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "By providing an ARM version of the malware, attackers can
                    expand their grasp, compromising devices that may not be
                    compatible with x86-based malware," the researchers
                    explained. "As ARM-based devices become more common,
                    cybercriminals will likely change their tactics to include
                    ARM-based malware, making their attacks stronger and able to
                    reach more targets."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Though it may be an old-timer when it comes to
                    malware, the Bifrost RAT remains a significant and evolving
                    threat to individuals and organizations alike, particularly
                    with new variants adopting

                    to evade detection, the researchers said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In their post, the researchers shared a list of
                    indicators of compromise, including malware samples and
                    domain and IP addresses associated with the latest Bifrost
                    Linux variants. The researchers advise that enterprises use
                    next-generation firewall products and

                  <p>
                    Ultimately, the process of infection allows the malware to
                    bypass security measures and evade detection, and ultimately
                    compromise targeted systems, the researchers said.

                    to guess and access, isn't that big of a deal. What was a
                    big deal is that Burke's research embarrassed Fox News. But
                    that's what journalists are supposed to do—uncover
                    questionable practices of powerful entities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Journalists need never ask corporations for permission to
                    investigate or embarrass them, and the law shouldn't
                    encourage or force them to. Just because someone doesn't
                    like what a reporter does online doesn't mean that it's
                    without authorization and that what he did is therefore a
                    crime.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, this isn't the first time that prosecutors have
                    abused computer hacking laws to go after journalists and
                    others, like

                    that their good faith investigations of algorithmic
                    discrimination could expose them to CFAA liability for
                    exceeding sites' terms of service.<br />[...]<br />If
                    journalists must seek permission to publish information they
                    find online from the very people they're exposing, as the
                    government's indictment of Burke suggests, it's a good bet
                    that most information from the obscure but public corners of
                    the Internet will never see the light of day. That would
                    endanger both journalism and public access to important
                    truths. The court reviewing Burke's case should dismiss the
                    charges.

                    "Our goal was to make proinsulin, purify it out to insulin,
                    and go from there," said Wheeler. "But the cow basically
                    processed it herself. She makes [a ratio of] about
                    three-to-one biologically active insulin to proinsulin. The
                    mammary gland is a magical thing."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The insulin and proinsulin were expressed at a few grams per
                    liter of milk. Because lactation was induced by hormones and
                    the milk volume was smaller than expected, the researchers
                    are unable to say exactly how much insulin a cow would make
                    during a typical lactation. But they're willing to hazard a
                    (conservative) guess; if proven correct, the numbers are
                    astounding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Wheeler said that if a cow produced one gram of
                    insulin per liter of milk and a typical Holstein cow – which
                    produces more milk than any other breed of dairy cow – made
                    40 to 50 liters a day, that adds up to a lot of insulin.
                    This is especially true considering that one international
                    unit (IU) of insulin is the biological equivalent of 0.0347
                    mg of pure crystalline insulin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "That means each gram is equivalent to 28,818 units of
                    insulin," Wheeler said. "And that's just one liter;
                    Holsteins can produce 50 liters a day. You can do the math."

                    AI assistants have been widely available for a little more
                    than a year, and they already have access to our most
                    private thoughts and business secrets. People ask them about
                    becoming pregnant or terminating or preventing pregnancy,
                    consult them when considering a divorce, seek information
                    about drug addiction, or ask for edits in emails containing
                    proprietary trade secrets. The providers of these AI-powered
                    chat services are keenly aware of the sensitivity of these
                    discussions and take active steps—mainly in the form of
                    encrypting them—to prevent potential snoops from reading
                    other people's interactions.

                    But now, researchers have devised an attack that deciphers
                    AI assistant responses with surprising accuracy. The
                    technique exploits a

                    Engineers are hopeful that the veteran spacecraft Voyager 1
                    might have turned a corner after spending the last three
                    months spouting gibberish at controllers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On March 1, the Voyager team sent a command, dubbed a
                    "poke," to get the probe's Flight Data System (FDS) to try
                    some other sequences in its software in the hope of
                    circumventing whatever had become corrupted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Readers of a certain vintage will doubtless have memories of
                    poke sheets for various 1980s games. Not that this hack ever
                    used a poke to get infinite lives in Jet Set Willy, of
                    course.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Voyager 1's lifespan is not infinite, it has endured
                    far longer than anticipated and might be about to dodge yet
                    another bullet. On March 3, the mission team saw something
                    different in the stream of data returned from the
                    spacecraft, which had been unreadable since December.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An engineer with the Deep Space Network (DSN) was able to
                    decode it, and by March 10, the team determined that it
                    contained a complete memory dump from the FDS.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The next step is to study the memory read-out and
                    compare it to one transmitted before the problem arose. A
                    solution to the issue could then be devised.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the original Voyager scientists, Garry Hunt, told The
                    Register that engineers at JPL were determined to get
                    communications with the stricken probe working again: "This
                    requires both skills and patience with the long time between
                    communication instructions and response."

                    [...] When Eve broke down the results by publisher, less
                    than 1 percent of the 204 publishers had put the majority of
                    their content into multiple archives. (The cutoff was 75
                    percent of their content in three or more archives.) Fewer
                    than 10 percent had put more than half their content in at
                    least two archives. And a full third seemed to be doing no
                    organized archiving at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The good news is that large academic publishers appear
                    to be reasonably good about getting things into archives;
                    most of the unarchived issues stem from smaller publishers.

                    [...] None of this is to say that we've already lost
                    important research documents. But Eve's paper serves a
                    valuable function by highlighting that the risk is real.
                    We're well into the era where print copies of journals are
                    irrelevant to most academics, and digital-only academic
                    journals have proliferated. It's long past time for us to
                    have clear standards in place to ensure that digital
                    versions of research have the endurance that print works
                    have enjoyed.

                    calls "Vector Games." The major parts of the XY Monitor are

                    weekend.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mr Barnett blew the whistle on alleged safety problems at
                    the aircraft manufacturing giant and had been giving
                    evidence in a lawsuit against the company in recent days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Mr Barnett's former employer, Boeing, has responded to
                    his death, saying: "We are saddened by Mr Barnett's passing,
                    and our thoughts are with his family and friends."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In 2019, Mr Barnett alleged that Boeing intentionally
                    used defective parts in its planes and warned that
                    passengers on its 787 Dreamliner might face a lack of oxygen
                    if a sudden decompression occurred.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] His attorney Brian Knowles told TMZ that he had
                    doubts about the circumstances of his death.

                Barnett's whistleblower complaint against the company has been
                pending for several years, according to court documents

                    John Barnett, 62, was a quality manager who retired in 2017
                    after several decades with the company. He died March 9 of
                    what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Barnett's whistleblower complaint has been pending for
                    more than seven years, according to a 2022 order denying
                    Boeing's motion to dismiss the case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Barnett originally filed a complaint with the
                    Occupational Safety and Health Administration in January
                    2017 alleging that Boeing retaliated against him. After
                    nearly four years, the agency concluded that there was no
                    retaliation, a decision that Barnett appealed about three
                    years ago. His case has been pending since then, as the two
                    sides have gone through discovery and prehearing motions.
