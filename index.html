                Larry Ellison (of Oracle) predicts a future of AI enabled
                mass-surveillance where everyone lives in a panopticon.
                Constantly watched and recorded by AI that reports all
                transgressions.

                    But this is only the start of our surveillance dystopia,
                    according to Larry Ellison, the billionaire cofounder of
                    Oracle. He said AI will usher in a new era of surveillance
                    that he gleefully said will ensure "citizens will be on
                    their best behavior."

                    Ellison's vision bears more than a passing resemblance to
                    the cautionary world portrayed in George Orwell's prescient
                    novel 1984. In Orwell's fiction, the totalitarian government
                    of Oceania uses ubiquitous "telescreens" to monitor citizens
                    constantly, creating a society where privacy no longer
                    exists and independent thought becomes nearly impossible.

                We have been getting stories for a while about how JWST
                observations don't line up with the current Big Bang timelines.
                I'm certain there will be "Big Bang Band Aid" theories at least
                until the current crop of Astrophysicists who built their entire
                career on the semi-biblical "In the Beginning..." theory of
                where it all started have, themselves, died off. Meanwhile,
                there is also never a shortage of contrarian theories out there,
                and one of them is starting to get some support from the JWST
                observations of the "deep past" - which, maybe, isn't so deep
                after all.
              </p>
              <p>
                Current theories for the redshift observed in more distant
                galaxies rely on the postulate: "photons travel at the speed of
                light and arrive unchanged at their destination, exactly when
                they left their source, from their perspective."
              </p>
              <p>
                There are other theories. One, in particular, explains the
                observed redshifts with the idea that photons "get tired" on
                their Billions of light year journeys and lose a little
                frequency / gain a little wavelength along the way. JWST
                observations that are seeing mature galaxies back at, and
                before, the previously presumed start of "it all" may align
                better with the less well developed tiring photon theory than
                they do with the Big Bang. Not only does the "tired light"
                theory directly explain red-shift, but the observations of
                wavelength shift with respect to galactic rotation seem to be
                lining up better with "tired light" than "Big Bang," too...
              </p>

                    Around the same time, Fritz Zwicky, a well-known astronomer,
                    came up with a different idea.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He proposed that the redshift we see in distant galaxies —
                    basically a shift in the light spectrum towards red — might
                    not be because those galaxies are speeding away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead, he thought that the light photons from these
                    galaxies could be losing energy, or "tiring out," as they
                    travel through space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This energy loss could make it look like the farther
                    galaxies are moving away from us faster than they actually
                    are.

                    The Tesla electric big rig, driven by a Tesla employee,
                    veered off the road on August 19, smashing into a traffic
                    post and a tree before careening down a slope and igniting a
                    post-crash inferno. Fortunately, no one was injured.
                    However, the NTSB's report sheds light on the difficulty of
                    extinguishing fires in electric vehicles. Tesla's infamous
                    "thermal runaway" effect—the tendency of lithium-ion
                    batteries to reignite hours after being "put out"—was a
                    constant concern, but the semi's battery system stayed under

                    [...] The blaze and the hazardous materials response that
                    followed created chaos along I-80, a key artery linking
                    Northern California with Nevada. Traffic was rerouted, and
                    the full shutdown stretched late into the evening, causing
                    significant delays.

                See, kid, back in the stone age we didn't have supercomputers in
                our pockets acting as telephones, we only had telephones. They
                were a permanent part of a room. If you weren't home, nobody
                could call you. But if you were a physician, people need to call
                you. So they had "pagers", also called "beepers," that alerted
                you to call the office.

              <p>
                They're not supposed to blow up. This is James Bond stuff. Since
                the Israelis can listen in to every cell phone call in the area,
                Hezbollah needed a secure way to communicate, so used pagers.
                But who loaded them with explosives? How? Pagers weren't big,
                the explosive must be high tech.

                    Large Language Models (LLMs) have not only fascinated
                    technologists and researchers but have also captivated the
                    general public. Leading the charge, OpenAI ChatGPT has
                    inspired the release of numerous open-source models. In this
                    post, I explore the dynamics that are driving the
                    commoditization of LLMs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Low switching costs are a key factor supporting the
                    commoditization of Large Language Models (LLMs). The
                    simplicity of transitioning from one LLM to another is
                    largely due to the use of a common language (English) for
                    queries. This uniformity allows for minimal cost when
                    switching, akin to navigating between different e-commerce
                    websites. While LLM providers might use various APIs, these
                    differences are not substantial enough to significantly
                    raise switching costs.

                    In contrast, transitioning between different database
                    systems involves considerable expense and complexity. It
                    requires migrating data, updating configurations, managing
                    traffic shifts, adapting to different query languages or
                    dialects, and addressing performance issues. Adding
                    long-term memory [<a

                    >] to LLMs could increase their value to businesses at the
                    cost of making it more expensive to switch providers.
                    However, for uses that require only the basic functions of
                    LLMs and do not need memory, the costs associated with
                    switching remain minimal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Open source models like Llama and Mistral allow
                    multiple infrastructure providers to enter the market,
                    enhancing competition and lowering the cost of AI services.
                    These models also benefit from community-driven
                    improvements, which in turn benefits the organizations that
                    originally developed them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, open source LLMs serve as a foundation for
                    future research, making experimentation more affordable and
                    reducing the potential for differentiation among competing
                    products. This mirrors the impact of Linux in the server
                    industry, where its rise enabled a variety of providers to
                    offer standardized server solutions at reduced costs,
                    thereby commoditizing server technology.

                    The HP-12c is probably the most iconic financial calculator.
                    Not being in finance myself, and in fact being terribly bad
                    at that kind of thing, I never quite got the purpose of
                    these special-purpose devices. My ignorance came to a halt
                    due to an unfortunate combination of my fixed-rate mortgage
                    period ending and Liz Truss happening, and I was driven to a
                    sudden keen interest in the 'time value of money' (TVM)
                    calculation.
                  </p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>
                    Earlier this year I came across a fairly benign-looking
                    reddit post describing some difficulty changing the decimal
                    point to a decimal comma on a new Brazilian-bought HP-12c.
                    Most of the replies were along the lines of 'you're holding
                    it wrong', but something caught my attention. They weren't
                    the only one, and not only had someone else had the same
                    experience, I was pointed to numerous Amazon reviews
                    describing similar woes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To find out for myself, I VPN'd myself over to the Brazilian
                    Amazon and started reading (with the assistance of my phone
                    and google translate) reviews. What I saw was quite
                    consistent - people couldn't change the point to the comma,
                    and the calculator also failed on something called the
                    internal rate of return (IRR) calculation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I was curious, were these a different version of the HP-12c?
                    Was it a fake? It is generally accepted that the HP-12c (and
                    to some degree the related HP-12c platinum) will return
                    exactly the same results no matter. Why would it otherwise?
                    It was at this point I needed help, and a very kind
                    Brazilian redditor did the work needed to run the
                    aforementioned TVM tests as a forensic tool. What they found
                    was a set of results entirely different to not just the
                    regular HP-12c, but to any other financial calculator we had
                    tested.

                    old are the ones where there's the most pressure to commit
                    pension fraud, and they also have the worst records. For
                    example, the best place to reach 105 in England is Tower
                    Hamlets. It has more 105-year-olds than all of the rich
                    places in England put together. It's closely followed by
                    downtown Manchester, Liverpool and Hull. Yet these places
                    have the lowest frequency of 90-year-olds and are rated by
                    the UK as the worst places to be an old person.

                    laugh and think about it, even if the scientific community
                    is still a bit prickly and defensive. If they don't

                    Less than 2% of the EU's heavy freight vehicles are now
                    electric and hydrogen-powered. To meet the bloc's carbon
                    emission reduction targets, the share should rise to 40% of
                    new sales by 2030, the study released before the IAA
                    Transportation 2024 truck show in Hanover showed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Currently production costs for electric trucks are 2.5-3
                    times higher than for diesel ones, the study said, and with
                    logistics firms unwilling to accept higher costs for
                    emissions-free freight, that goal is still distant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To overcome that, prices for new electric trucks should be
                    no more than 30% higher than for diesel models, McKinsey
                    said, which would require a technological leap in batteries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For successful implementation of the EU's CO2 strategy, a
                    25% cut in charging costs is also needed, the study showed,
                    with 900,000 private charging points to be installed in
                    Europe by 2035, which would require a $20 billion
                    investment.

                    to be behind the Charles Darwin School attack. In a post on
                    the criminals' dark-web blog, they say they stole 200 GB of
                    data, including user, business data, employee, student and
                    financial information.

                    more frequently despite having the latest security measures
                    in place," he said. "Our understanding of our situation is
                    that it is similar to what was experienced by the NHS,
                    Transport for London, National Rail, other schools and

                    attacking schools in Washington state and the UK," Semperis
                    principal technologist Sean Deuby told
                    <em>The Register</em>, adding that schools are more
                    vulnerable targets because of their smaller IT budgets and
                    fewer defensive resources. "Attacking just before the first
                    day of school for young kindergartners demonstrates their
                    amorality."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the Seattle-area district hasn't called the incident
                    ransomware, "reading between the lines on these attacks
                    leads me to believe that the schools were hit by
                    ransomware," Deuby opined.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Most schools today use Office 365 but still depend
                    upon their on-premises identity system, Active Directory,
                    for its users," Deuby said, adding that this makes
                    exploiting Microsoft AD vulnerabilities more enticing to
                    criminals. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While there's "no silver bullet" to solve schools' security
                    challenges, he suggests working with their IT providers to
                    identify critical services "such as AD that are single
                    points of failure." 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If critical services go down, school stops, and the school
                    buses don't roll," Deuby noted. "Have a plan for what to do.
                    This doesn't have to be perfect but think now about what to
                    do if email goes away or a teacher portal is locked."

                    For some context, Loongson is a Chinese fabless chip company

                    launched in late 2023 is claimed to match AMD's Zen 3 and
                    Intel's Tiger Lake architectures from 2020. While the
                    company has mostly played in the CPU space until now, the
                    GPU offerings represent a new push.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Their current model, the 9A1000, is a pretty tame GPU aimed
                    at budget systems and low-end AI tasks. But the 9A2000 is
                    allegedly taking things to the next level.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Loongson's Chairman and General Manager Hu
                    Weiwu, the 9A2000 delivers performance up to 10 times higher
                    than its predecessor. He claimed it should be "comparable to
                    Nvidia RTX 2080,"
                    <a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/794/762.htm">according</a>

                  <p>
                    [...] That said, Loongson has another card to play. At the
                    same briefing, Weiwu also provided a teaser for their
                    next-gen 3B6600 CPU, making some lofty performance claims
                    about its architecture. He touted "significant" changes
                    under the hood that should elevate its single-threaded
                    muscle to "world-leading" levels,
                    <a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/794/753.htm">according</a>
                    to another ITHome report.

                  <p>
                    Previous leaks suggest this processor will pack eight LA864
                    cores clocked at a stout 3GHz, along with integrated LG200
                    graphics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for the launch, Weiwu gave a tentative first half of 2025
                    target for initial production, with mass availability
                    hopefully following in the second half of next year.

                    of x86 and Arm in per-core performance, it would mark a
                    major step up for the company.

                    Arrays of gene variants in Thorin’s DNA more closely align
                    with the previously reported DNA structure of Neandertals
                    that lived around 105,000 years ago, versus Neandertals
                    dating to around 50,000 to 40,000 years ago. Yet analyses of
                    carbon and other diet-related chemical elements in Thorin’s
                    bones and teeth suggest that he lived during an ice age,
                    which did not develop in Europe until about 50,000 years

                    Thorin also inherited from his parents an unusually high
                    percentage of DNA segments containing consecutive pairs of
                    identical gene variants.

                    population (<em>SN: 10/19/22</em>).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Taken together, the genetic evidence fits a scenario in
                    which Thorin belonged to a Neandertal lineage that split
                    from other European Neandertals around 105,000 years ago,
                    the researchers say. For roughly the next 50,000 years, they
                    suspect, Thorin’s lineage consisted of small networks of
                    closely related communities that exchanged mates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Reasons why those ancient groups avoided mating with other
                    Neandertals in the region, possibly related to language or
                    cultural differences, are unclear, Sikora says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “If Thorin is really 50,000 years old, this would be
                    an amazing finding showing a strong genetic structure in
                    late Neandertals,” says paleogeneticist Cosimo Posth of the
                    University of Tübingen in Germany. But, he says, further
                    excavation and research at Grotte Mandrin will need to
                    confirm when Thorin lived.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers found Thorin’s remains in a small, natural
                    depression on the rock shelter floor. Slimak’s and Sikora’s
                    group cannot yet say how the body got there or whether it
                    originated in older sediment. An older date for the partial
                    skeleton would indicate, less surprisingly, that Thorin
                    belonged to an isolated population that petered out quickly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Long-term isolation would have resulted in Thorin inheriting
                    a greater number of short DNA segments containing identical
                    gene pairs than reported in the new study, Lalueza-Fox says.
                    Isolating more of Thorin’s DNA or collecting genetic
                    remnants from other fossil members of his lineage will
                    clarify the evolutionary story of these close-knit
                    Neandertals, he says.

                    [...] As a daily tech news writer, I keep an eye on the
                    latest innovations in AI image generation. Late last month
                    while browsing Reddit, I noticed a post from an AI imagery
                    hobbyist who goes by the name "<a
                      href="https://x.com/fofrAI"
                      >fofr</a
                    >"—pronounced "Foffer," he told me, so let's call him that
                    for convenience. Foffer announced that he had
                    <a
                      href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1f0hs79/you_can_train_handwriting_loras_with_flux/"
                      >replicated J.R.R. Tolkien's handwriting</a

                  <p>
                    [...] Foffer's breakthrough was realizing that Flux can be
                    customized using a special technique called "LoRA" (short
                    for "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685"
                      >low-rank adaptation</a
                    >") to imitate someone's handwriting in a very realistic
                    way. LoRA is a modular method of fine-tuning Flux to teach
                    it new concepts that weren't in its original training
                    dataset—the initial set of pictures and illustrations
                    <a href="https://blackforestlabs.ai/">its creator</a> used
                    to teach it how to synthesize images.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "I don't want to encourage people to copy other's
                    handwriting, especially signatures," Foffer told me in an
                    interview the day he took the Tolkien model down. But said
                    he would help me attempt to apply his technique to a less
                    famous individual for an article, telling me how I could
                    inexpensively train

                    on a cloud AI hosting site called Replicate. "I think you
                    should try it. I think you'll be surprised how fun and easy
                    it is," he said.

                  <p>
                    Lucina Uddin, a professor of psychology at the University of
                    California, Los Angeles, is the named plaintiff in an
                    antitrust lawsuit against six publishers of academic
                    journals: Elsevier, Wolters Kluwer, Wiley, Sage, Taylor and
                    Francis Group, and Springer. The lawsuit accuses the
                    publishers of collusion in violation of Section 1 of the
                    Sherman Act, stating that they "conspired to unlawfully
                    appropriate billions of dollars that would have otherwise
                    funded scientific research."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The plaintiff "seeks to recover treble damages, an
                    injunction, and other relief."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit, filed in federal district court in New York,
                    can be read in its entirety
                    <a

                      >here</a
                    >. The early paragraphs in which the publishers' "scheme" is
                    described are a good read:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <p>
                        The Publisher Defendants' Scheme has three primary
                        components. First, the Publisher Defendants agreed to
                        not compensate scholars for their labor, in particular
                        not to pay for their peer review services (the "Unpaid
                        Peer Review Rule"). In other words, the Publisher
                        Defendants agreed to fix the price of peer review
                        services at zero. The Publisher Defendants also agreed
                        to coerce scholars into providing their labor for
                        nothing by expressly linking their unpaid labor with
                        their ability to get their manuscripts published in the
                        Publisher Defendants' journals. In the "publish or
                        perish" world of academia, the Publisher Defendants
                        essentially agreed to hold the careers of scholars
                        hostage so that the Publisher Defendants could force
                        them to provide their valuable labor for free.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Second, the Publisher Defendants agreed not to compete
                        with each other for manuscripts by requiring scholars to
                        submit their manuscripts to only one journal at a time
                        (the "Single Submission Rule"). The Single Submission
                        Rule substantially reduces competition among the
                        Publisher Defendants, substantially decreasing
                        incentives to review manuscripts promptly and publish
                        meritorious research quickly. The Single Submission Rule
                        also robs scholars of negotiating leverage they
                        otherwise would have had if more than one journal
                        offered to publish their manuscripts. Thus, the
                        Publisher Defendants know that if they offer to publish
                        a manuscript, the submitting scholar has no viable
                        alternative and the Publisher Defendant can then dictate
                        the terms of publication.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Third, the Publisher Defendants agreed to prohibit
                        scholars from freely sharing the scientific advancements
                        described in submitted manuscripts while those
                        manuscripts are under peer review, a process that often
                        takes over a year (the "Gag Rule"). From the moment
                        scholars submit manuscripts for publication, the
                        Publisher Defendants behave as though the scientific
                        advancements set forth in the manuscripts are their
                        property, to be shared only if the Publisher Defendants
                        grant permission. Moreover, when the Publisher
                        Defendants select manuscripts for publication, the
                        Publisher Defendants will often require scholars to sign
                        away all intellectual property rights, in exchange for
                        nothing. The manuscripts then become the actual property
                        of the Publisher Defendants, and the Publisher
                        Defendants charge the maximum the market will bear for
                        access to that scientific knowledge.

                    The IARC classification relied on previous observational
                    studies where people with brain cancer reported they used a
                    mobile phone more than they actually did. One example of

                  <p>
                    This new systematic review of human observational studies is
                    based on a much larger data set compared to what the IARC
                    examined in 2011.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It is the most comprehensive review on this topic – it
                    considered more than 5,000 studies, of which 63, published
                    between 1994 and 2022, were included in the final analysis.
                    The main reason studies were excluded was that they were not
                    actually relevant; this is very normal with search results
                    from systematic reviews.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No association between mobile phone use and brain cancer, or
                    any other head or neck cancer, was found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There was also no association with cancer if a person used a
                    mobile phone for ten or more years (prolonged use). How
                    often they used it – either based on the number of calls or
                    the time spent on the phone – also didn't make a difference.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Importantly, these findings align with
                    <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/12/e024489.full"

                    been no rise in the incidence of brain cancers.

                    imported energy, and the country is still not on track to

                Five BlueBird satellites have launched as part of AST

                    Bad news for sky watchers: Earth's orbit has been littered
                    by five more gigantic satellites which are poised to become
                    the brightest objects in the night sky.

                    orbit, according to AST SpaceMobile. The company's prototype

                    In the 20th century, nations built international
                    institutions to allow the spread of peaceful nuclear energy
                    but slow nuclear weapons proliferation by controlling access
                    to the raw materials—namely weapons-grade uranium and
                    plutonium—that underpins them. The risk has been managed
                    through international institutions, such as the
                    <a href="https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/atomic-energy"
                      >Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and International Atomic
                      Energy Agency</a
                    >. Today, 32 nations operate nuclear power plants, which
                    collectively provide 10% of the world's electricity, and
                    only nine countries possess nuclear weapons.

                  <p>
                    Countries can do something similar for AI today. They can
                    regulate AI from the ground up by controlling access to the
                    highly specialized chips that are needed to train the
                    world's most advanced AI models.

                    While this doesn't include major food crops like rice and
                    wheat, pollination is essential to what the study's first
                    author – ecologist Katherine Turo from Rutgers University in
                    the US –

                  <p>
                    "If you look through a list of crops and think about which
                    fruits and vegetables you're most excited to eat – like
                    summer berries or apples and pumpkins in the fall – those
                    are the crops that typically need to be pollinated by
                    insects," Turo
                    <a
                      href="https://www.rutgers.edu/news/are-crops-worldwide-sufficiently-pollinated"

                    And yet, there's a lack of experimental research on
                    pollinator limitation in crops. While we know the phenomenon
                    is impacting global food supplies, its prevalence has so far
                    been unclear.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Within this detailed picture, Turo and colleagues
                    found that up to 60 percent of global crop systems are being
                    limited by insufficient pollination. The phenomenon is
                    affecting 25 of the 49 different crop species analyzed, with
                    blueberry, coffee, and apple crops being the worst affected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pollinator limitation is occurring in 85 percent of the
                    countries in this database, spanning all six continents
                    represented.

                    "Our findings are a cause for concern and optimism," says
                    Turo.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We did detect widespread yield deficits. However, we also
                    estimate that, through continued investment in pollinator
                    management and research, it is likely that we can improve
                    the efficiency of our existing crop fields to meet the
                    nutritional needs of our global population."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Our findings show that by paying more attention to
                    pollinators, growers could make agricultural fields more
                    productive."

                    Curiosity is the driving force behind all science, which may
                    explain why so many scientists sometimes find themselves
                    going in some decidedly eccentric research directions. Did
                    you hear about the WWII plan to train pigeons as missile
                    guidance systems? How about experiments on the swimming
                    ability of a dead rainbow trout or that time biologists
                    tried to startle cows by popping paper bags by their heads?
                    These and other unusual research endeavors were honored
                    tonight in a virtual ceremony to announce the 2024
                    recipients of the annual Ig Nobel Prizes. Yes, it's that
                    time of year again, when the serious and the silly
                    converge—for science.

                    for their vital work."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawmakers went on to note that traditional search
                    results lead users to publishers' websites while
                    AI-generated summaries keep the users on the search platform
                    "where that platform alone can profit from the user's
                    attention through advertising and data collection."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These products also have significant competitive
                    consequences that distort markets for content. When a
                    generative AI feature answers a query directly, it often
                    forces the content creator—whose content has been relegated
                    to a lower position on the user interface—to compete with
                    content generated from their own work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fact that AI may be scraping news sites and then not
                    even directing users to the original source could be a form
                    of "exclusionary conduct or an unfair method of competition
                    in violation of antitrust laws," the lawmakers concluded.

                    Softguard Systems was founded by Joseph Diodati, Paul Sachse
                    and Ken Williams in 1983¹. The company went public in 1984,
                    and by 1985 was one of the industry leaders in copy
                    protection technology, although they produced a few other
                    unrelated products as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Advertisements for their copy-protection product, SUPERLoK,
                    were commonly seen in the classified sections of
                    publications such as InfoWorld and PC Magazine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The original Superlok product required professional disk
                    duplication to lay down the requisite copy protection track.
                    Eventually, Softguard would produce the "SUPERLoK KIT,"
                    which was writable with a standard PC floppy controller. An
                    advertisement for the Kit can be seen above, left. The Kit
                    version was aimed at smaller developers on a budget, and did
                    not offer the same level of protection. This article will
                    focus on the original Superlok product.

                    [...] What they had come up with was an AI that can analyse
                    how sound bounces around a room before reaching the
                    microphone or ear.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We catch the sound as it arrives at each microphone,
                    backtrack to figure out where it came from, and then, in
                    essence, we suppress any sound that couldn't have come from
                    where the person is sitting," says Mr McElveen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The effect is comparable in certain respects to when a
                    camera focusses on one subject and blurs out the foreground
                    and background.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The results don't sound crystal clear when you can only use
                    a very noisy recording to learn from, but they're still
                    stunning."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The technology had its first real-world forensic use in a US
                    murder case, where the evidence it was able to provide
                    proved central to the convictions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Since then, other government laboratories, including
                    in the UK, have put it through a battery of tests. The
                    company is now marketing the technology to the US military,
                    which has used it to analyse sonar signals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Eventually it aims to introduce tailored versions of
                    its product for use in audio recording kit, voice interfaces
                    for cars, smart speakers, augmented and virtual reality,
                    sonar and hearing aid devices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, for example, if you speak to your car or smart speaker
                    it wouldn't matter if there was a lot of noise going on
                    around you, the device would still be able to make out what
                    you were saying.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The math in all our tests shows remarkable
                    similarities with human hearing. There's little oddities
                    about what our algorithm can do, and how accurately it can
                    do it, that are astonishingly similar to some of the
                    oddities that exist in human hearing," says McElveen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We suspect that the human brain may be using the same math
                    - that in solving the cocktail party problem, we may have
                    stumbled upon what's really happening in the brain."

                    One port that’s not nearly as popular or playable as the
                    others is the Sega Saturn port that came out nearly four
                    years after the game’s release.
                    <a
                      href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-review/1900-2532876/"

                    called the Sega Saturn <em>Doom </em>port just about
                    everything you can call a bad game without straying over the
                    the boundaries of good taste: “completely worthless,”
                    “drab,” “jerky,” “to be avoided at all costs.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bo, a self-described reverse engineer of Sega Saturn games,
                    gave the Sega Saturn port of <em>Doom </em>another chance
                    and he discovered a cheat code in the game that’s been
                    laying dormant for more than a decade. He posted
                    <a

                    The button combination X, Right, B, Y, X, Right, B, Y gives
                    you the ability to see through the walls of the Mars
                    substation and even Hell. It’s too bad the game doesn’t have
                    a cheat code that lets you see a better version of
                    <em>Doom</em>.

                    One of the things enterprise storage and destruction company
                    Iron Mountain does is handle the archiving of the media
                    industry's vaults. What it has been seeing lately should be
                    a wake-up call: roughly one-fifth of the hard disk drives
                    dating to the 1990s it was sent are entirely unreadable.

                    The gist of it: You cannot trust any medium, so you copy
                    important things over and over, into fresh storage. "Optical
                    media rots, magnetic media rots and loses magnetic charge,
                    bearings seize, flash storage loses charge, etc.,"

                    The study also identified stretches of DNA in the ancient
                    Rapa Nui genomes that have an Indigenous American origin.
                    Their analysis suggests that the mixing of these populations
                    occurred around the 1300s.

                  <p>
                    “Our interpretation is that the ancestors of Rapa Nui first
                    peopled the island and shortly after made a return journey
                    to the Americas,” says Moreno-Mayer.

                    "It needs to be made clear that Oasis leave decisions on

                    management, and at no time had any awareness that dynamic

                    It said that "meetings between promoters, Ticketmaster and
                    the band's management" had resulted in an agreement to use
                    dynamic pricing "to help keep general ticket prices down as

                    The RX 7800M is a powerful mobile GPU for gaming notebooks.

                  <p>
                    AMD has officially debuted its sixth discrete GPU in its
                    mobile RX 7000 lineup, the
                    <a

                      >RX 7800M</a
                    >. The new GPU is AMD's second mobile RDNA 3 GPU to arrive
                    with a chipset-style architecture and is the runner-up to
                    the flagship RX 7900M.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The RX 7800M is armed with 60 RDNA 3 compute units, 96 ROPS,
                    3,840 stream processors, 48MB of Infinity Cache, and a game
                    clock of 2,145MHz. Bus width was not mentioned, but we
                    suspect it is using a 192-bit interface. Memory bandwidth is
                    rated at up to 432GB/s, memory capacity is 12GB, and GDDR6
                    ICs operate at up to 18 Gbps. GPU power consumption is rated
                    at up to 180W.

                    that the RX 7800M performs very similarly to AMD’s desktop

                    >. This is unsurprising since both GPUs share the same
                    memory configuration, and the GPU’s superior core count
                    configuration offsets the 7700 XT’s low power/clock speed.
                    Compared to Nvidia, the RX 7800M performs faster than its
                    RTX 4070 laptop GPU but is slower than its RTX 4080 mobile
                    counterpart. Performance was also a touch behind Nvidia’s

                    the additional 26 trillion MBs used last year is a 36
                    percent increase over 2022 and is the largest single-year
                    increase in wireless data ever. It is also enough data for
                    every household in the country to watch the first season of
                    House of the Dragon daily for an entire year.

                    By 2029, Ericsson predicts that Americans' data usage could

                    The continued proliferation of 5G networks is helping to
                    drive growth as well. The CTIA said that by the end of 2023,
                    nearly 40 percent of all wireless connections – including
                    smartphones, IoT devices, and wearables – were 5G and that
                    more than 330 million Americans were covered by at least one
                    5G network. The total number of wireless connections reached
                    558 million, or more than 1.6 connections for each American.

                    is only expected to increase in the coming years as network
                    operators pump even more money into the system. The industry
                    collectively invested $30 billion in 2023 to improve their
                    networks, pushing the total US wireless industry spend to
                    more than $700 billion to date ($190 billion of which has
                    come since 2018). A total of 432,469 cell sites were in
                    operation across the country at the end of 2023, an increase
                    of 24 percent since 2018.

                    Wireless data is also more affordable now than it ever has
                    been. The cost per MB has dropped 50 percent since 2020 and
                    97 percent versus a decade ago, down to just $.002 per MB.

                    Azure Linux, and indeed, for Azure in general."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Does the future of Azure Linux lie somewhere other than a
                    relatively obscure way to host containers on AKS? Foley
                    asked Microsoft and was told: "Azure Linux for VM or bare
                    metal use is not available as a commercially supported
                    offering today. Support is limited to AKS as the host OS."
                  </p>
                  <p>Note the word "today" in that response.</p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft is unlikely to make much money directly from Azure
                    Linux going wide. However, it would be a useful driver to
                    the company's Azure cloud platform and soothe concerns over
                    support and maintenance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, for many administrators, an attitude of "Anything
                    but Microsoft" persists, certainly since

                    a challenge that should not be underestimated. ®

                    "Even a pure 'transparency' measure, if it compels
                    non-commercial speech, is subject to strict scrutiny," Smith
                    wrote, concluding that X would likely suffer irreparable
                    harm if key parts of the law weren't blocked.<br />[...]<br />Smith
                    ordered the case to be remanded to the district court "with
                    instructions to enter a preliminary injunction consistent
                    with the opinion." The district court will also have to
                    determine if unconstitutional parts of the law "are
                    severable from the remainder of AB 587 and, if so, which, if
                    any, of the remaining challenged provisions should also be

                    This is the outcome that the state had asked for if the

                    chance to preserve some parts of the law. But if the
                    district court decides to strike the entire content
                    moderation report section from the law, AB 587 would be
                    properly gutted—basically only requiring social media
                    companies to post their terms of service on a government
                    website. That's the only part of the law that X did not
                    fight to enjoin on appeal.

                  <p>
                    The threat actor that Microsoft tracks as Citrine Sleet is
                    based in North Korea and primarily targets financial
                    institutions, particularly organizations and individuals
                    managing cryptocurrency, for financial gain. As part of its
                    social engineering tactics, Citrine Sleet has conducted
                    extensive reconnaissance of the cryptocurrency industry and
                    individuals associated with it. The threat actor creates
                    fake websites masquerading as legitimate cryptocurrency
                    trading platforms and uses them to distribute fake job
                    applications or lure targets into downloading a weaponized
                    cryptocurrency wallet or trading application based on
                    legitimate applications. Citrine Sleet most commonly infects
                    targets with the unique trojan malware it developed,
                    AppleJeus, which collects information necessary to seize
                    control of the targets' cryptocurrency assets. The FudModule
                    rootkit described in this blog has now been tied to Citrine
                    Sleet as shared tooling with Diamond Sleet.

                    The 53-year-old businessman made his predictions on a series
                    of social media posts this weekend. He said the next
                    "Earth-Mars transfer window" opens in two years, which is
                    when the first Starships to the "Red Planet" will launch.
                    Musk said the Starships will be uncrewed at first "to test
                    the reliability of landing intact on Mars."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But if everything goes well and the landings are successful,
                    just two years later the first crewed flights to Mars will
                    start departing from our planet. Musk said once the first
                    crewed flights depart, their rate will "grow exponentially",
                    adding that his company has the goal of "building a
                    self-sustaining city in about 20 years."

                    [...] "Being multiplanetary will vastly increase the
                    probable lifespan of consciousness, as we will no longer
                    have all our eggs, literally and metabolically, on one
                    planet." Many people were excited by Musk's latest claims as
                    one wrote: "This is huge!!" Another added: "What a time to
                    be alive!" One more commented: "The mission to make life
                    multi-planetary really begins."

                    Founded in 2002, Musk's SpaceX became the first private
                    company to develop a liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit
                    and the first to send a spacecraft and astronauts to the
                    International Space Station. A year earlier, he had
                    announced the development of Mars Oasis - a project bidding
                    to land a greenhouse and grow plants on Mars.

                    booster called Super Heavy and a 165-foot-tall upper-stage
                    spacecraft known as Starship. The spacecraft is designed to
                    be "a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry
                    both crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and

                    A leak of data from Disney points to the Disney+ streaming
                    service making about $2.4 billion in revenue in its fiscal
                    quarter ending on March 30. Disney doesn't normally share
                    how much revenue its individual streaming services generate,
                    making this figure particularly interesting.

                    that it was investigating the leak of "over a terabyte of
                    data from one of the communication systems" it uses. In a
                    report this week,
                    <a

                      >The Wall Street Journal</a
                    >
                    (WSJ) said it looked over files leaked by a hacking group
                    called Nullbulge that include "a range of financial and
                    strategy information," apparent login credentials for parts
                    of Disney's cloud infrastructure, and more. The leak
                    includes over "44 million messages from Disney's Slack
                    workplace communications tool, upward of 18,800
                    spreadsheets, and at least 13,000 PDFs," WSJ said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We decline to comment on unverified information The Wall
                    Street Journal has purportedly obtained as a result of a bad
                    actor's illegal activity," a Disney spokesperson told WSJ.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to WSJ, financial information came via "documents
                    shared by staffers that detail company operations," adding,
                    "It isn't official data of the sort Disney discloses to Wall
                    Street and might not reflect final financial performance for
                    a given period." That means we should take these figures
                    with a grain of salt.

                  <p>
                    "Internal spreadsheets suggest that Disney+ generated more
                    than $2.4 billion in revenue in the March quarter," WSJ
                    reported, referencing Disney's fiscal Q2 2024. "It
                    underscores how significant a revenue contributor Hulu is,
                    particularly as Disney seeks to buy out Comcast's stake in
                    that streaming service, and as the two sides spar over its
                    value."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The publication noted that the $2.4 billion figure
                    represents "about 43 percent"—42.5 percent to be more
                    precise—of the direct-to-consumer (DTC) revenue that Disney
                    reported that quarter, which totaled $5,642,000,000 [<a
                      href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/q2-fy24-earnings.pdf"
                      >PDF</a
                    >]. In its Q2 report, Disney put Disney+, Hulu, and Disney+
                    Hotstar under its DTC umbrella. DTC revenue in Q2
                    represented a 13 percent increase compared to the same
                    quarter in the prior fiscal year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Further, subscriber counts for Disney+ and Hulu increased
                    year over year in Q2. The leaks didn't specify how much
                    revenue Disney's streaming businesses made in Q3, but Disney
                    reported that DTC revenue increased to $5.8 billion [<a
                      href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/q3-fy24-earnings.pdf"

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Right before announcing its Q3 numbers, though,
                    Disney announced
                    <a
                      href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/so-tired-disney-hulu-espn-prices-increase-by-up-to-25-percent-in-october/"
                      >price hikes</a
                    >
                    across Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ by as much as 25 percent. As
                    we wrote at the time, the price hike seemed like an attempt
                    to push people toward bundle packages offering a combination
                    of Disney+, Hulu, and/or ESPN+ (bundles are supposed to make
                    subscriber churn less likely). Disney CFO Hugh Johnston
                    tried convincing us that Disney's streaming catalog meant
                    that it had

                  <p>
                    But the recently leaked numbers shed a little more light on
                    the situation.

                    Cloudflare's global network handles a lot of HTTP requests –
                    over 60 million per second on average. That in and of itself
                    is not news, but it is the starting point to an adventure
                    that started a few months ago and ends with the announcement
                    of a new open-source Rust crate that we are using to reduce
                    our CPU utilization, enabling our CDN to handle even more of
                    the world's ever-increasing Web traffic.
                  </p>
                  <p>Motivation</p>
                  <p>
                    Let's start at the beginning. You may recall a few months
                    ago we released Pingora (the heart of our Rust-based proxy
                    services) as an open-source project on GitHub. I work on the
                    team that maintains the Pingora framework, as well as
                    Cloudflare's production services built upon it. One of those
                    services is responsible for the final step in transmitting
                    users' (non-cached) requests to their true destination.
                    Internally, we call the request's destination server its
                    "origin", so our service has the (unimaginative) name of
                    "pingora-origin".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the many responsibilities of pingora-origin is to
                    ensure that when a request leaves our infrastructure, it has
                    been cleaned to remove the internal information we use to
                    route, measure, and optimize traffic for our customers. This
                    has to be done for every request that leaves Cloudflare, and
                    as I mentioned above, it's a lot of requests. At the time of
                    writing, the rate of requests leaving pingora-origin
                    (globally) is 35 million requests per second.

                    It's not every day that a security researcher acquires the
                    ability to generate counterfeit HTTPS certificates, track
                    email activity, and execute code of his choice on thousands
                    of servers—all in a single blow that cost only $20 and a few
                    minutes to land. But that's exactly what happened recently
                    to Benjamin Harris.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Harris, the CEO and founder of security firm watchTowr, did
                    all of this by registering the domain dotmobilregistry.net.
                    The domain was once the official home of the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.icann.org/en/registry-agreements/org/org-registry-agreement--whois-specifications-8-12-2006-en"

                    >
                    server for .mobi<br />[...]<br />Harris noticed that the
                    previous dotmobiregistry.net owners had allowed the domain
                    to expire. He then scooped it up and set up his own .mobi
                    WHOIS server there.
                  </p>

                    To Harris's surprise, his server received queries from
                    slightly more than 76,000 unique IP addresses within a few
                    hours of setting it up. Over five days, it received roughly
                    2.5 million queries from about 135,000 unique systems. The
                    entities behind the systems querying his deprecated domain
                    included a who's who of Internet heavyweights comprising
                    domain registrars, providers of online security tools,
                    governments from the US and around the world, universities,
                    and certificate authorities, the entities that issue
                    browser-trusted TLS certificates that make HTTPS work.

                    official host table and published the ARPANET Directory,
                    which acted as a directory of phone numbers and email
                    addresses of all network users.

                      >Eventually</a
                    >, the directory evolved into the WHOIS system, a
                    query-based server that provided a comprehensive list of all
                    Internet host names and the entities that had registered
                    them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite its antiquated look and feel, WHOIS today remains an
                    essential resource with tremendous consequences.<br />[...]<br />Harris
                    populated his WHOIS database with junk data that
                    corresponded to all real .mobi addresses. Administrative
                    email addresses, and most other fields led to the
                    watchtowr.com domain. For humor, he also added ASCII art.<br />[...]<br />The
                    humor aside, the rogue WHOIS server gave him powers he never
                    should have had. One of the greatest was the ability to
                    dictate the email address certificate authority GlobalSign
                    used to determine if a party applying for a TLS certificate
                    was the rightful owner of the domain name the certificate
                    would apply to. Like the vast majority of its competitors,
                    GlobalSign uses an automated process. An application for
                    example.com, for instance, will prompt the certificate
                    authority to send an email to the administrative email
                    address listed in the authoritative WHOIS for that domain.
                    If the party on the other end clicks a link, the certificate
                    is automatically approved.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When Harris generated a certificate signing request for
                    microsoft.mobi, he promptly received an email from
                    GlobalSign. The email gave him the option of receiving a
                    verification link at whois@watchtowr.com. For ethical
                    reasons, he stopped the experiment at this point.<br />[...]<br />"The
                    purchase of a $20 domain that allowed the passive inference
                    of .gov/.mil communications and the subversion of the
                    Certificate Authority verification system should be a clear
                    demonstration that the integrity of the trust and security
                    processes we as Internet users rely on is, and continues to
                    be, extremely fragile," Harris wrote in an online interview.
                    "The systems and security we all take for granted is, in
                    many places, truly held together in ways that would not pass
                    approval in 2024."

                    [...] One area where V2X could make the largest impact is
                    for autonomous vehicles (AVs). The number and sophistication
                    of sensors in an autonomous vehicle are vast and increase
                    with the level of autonomy. AVs like those in Phoenix or San
                    Francisco currently depend on LiDAR
                    <i>[light detection and ranging]</i>, radar, and cameras for
                    the majority of their perception. Each sensor fulfills
                    important functions and ensures robust and safe operation,
                    but these vehicle sensor systems are limited by
                    line-of-sight. Using either DSRC or C-V2X, autonomous
                    vehicles can transmit information at a dedicated frequency
                    (~5.9GHz), with V2X acting as an extra sensor that works in
                    all weather conditions and can go through walls and
                    obstacles, effectively solving the line-of-sight problem.
                    The main feasible method for achieving this is to use V2X to
                    broadcast the location-related information of each car. A
                    connected vehicle receiving the information can calculate
                    the possibility of collision with the other vehicle using
                    onboard compute. If the risk is high, the driver (or
                    passenger of an autonomous vehicle) will be immediately
                    warned, and the system will adjust accordingly to avoid a
                    collision safely and effectively.

                    Ford Motor Company is seeking a patent for technology that
                    would allow it to tailor in-car advertising by listening to
                    conversations among vehicle occupants, as well as by
                    analyzing a car's historical location and other data,
                    according to a patent application published late last month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In one example, the controller may monitor user dialogue to
                    detect when individuals are in a conversation," the patent
                    application says. "The conversations can be parsed for
                    keywords or phrases that may indicate where the occupants
                    are traveling to."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The tech — labeled as "in-vehicle advertisement
                    presentation" — will determine where a car is located, how
                    fast it is traveling, what type of road it is driving on and
                    whether it is in traffic. It also will predict routes,
                    speeds and destinations to customize ads to drivers, the
                    application said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The system could pull data from "audio signals within the
                    vehicle and/or historical user data, selecting a number of
                    the advertisements to present to the user during the trip,"
                    the patent application said.

                    The three princes of Sarandib—an ancient Persian name for
                    Sri Lanka—get exiled by their father the king. They are good
                    boys, but he wants them to experience the wider world and
                    its peoples and be tested by them before they take over the
                    kingdom. They meet a cameleer who has lost his camel and
                    tell him they've seen it—though they have not—and prove it
                    by describing three noteworthy characteristics of the
                    animal: it is blind in one eye, it has a tooth missing, and
                    it has a lame leg.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After some hijinks the camel is found, and the princes are
                    correct. How could they have known? They used their keen
                    observational skills to notice unusual things, and their wit
                    to interpret those observations to reveal a truth that was
                    not immediately apparent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is a very old tale, sometimes involving an elephant or a
                    horse instead of a camel. But this is the version written by
                    Amir Khusrau in Delhi in 1301 in his poem
                    <i>The Eight Tales of Paradise</i>, and this is the version
                    that one Christopher the Armenian clumsily translated into
                    the Venetian novel <i>The Three Princes of Serendip</i>,
                    published in 1557; a publication that, in a roundabout way,
                    brought the word "serendipity" into the English language.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In no version of the story do the princes accidentally
                    stumble across something important they were not looking
                    for, or find something they were looking for but in a
                    roundabout, unanticipated manner, or make a valuable
                    discovery based on a false belief or misapprehension.
                    Chance, luck, and accidents, happy or otherwise, play no
                    role in their tale. Rather, the trio use their astute
                    observations as fodder for their abductive reasoning. Their
                    main talent is their ability to spot surprising, unexpected
                    things and use their observations to formulate hypotheses
                    and conjectures that then allow them to deduce the existence
                    of something they've never before seen.

                      >Telmo Pievani</a
                    >, the first Italian chair of Philosophy of Biological
                    Sciences at the University of Padua, eventually comes to
                    define serendipity in his new book,
                    <i>Serendipity: the Unexpected in Science</i>. It's hardly a
                    mind-bending or world-altering read, but it is a cute and
                    engaging one, especially when his many stories of discovery
                    veer into ruminations on the nature of inquiry and of
                    science itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He starts with the above-mentioned romp through global
                    literature, culminating in the joint coining and
                    misunderstanding of the term as we know it today: in 1754,
                    after reading the popular English translation entitled
                    <i
                      >The Travels and Adventures of Three Princes of
                      Serendip</i
                    >, the intellectual Horace Walpole described
                    "<i>Serendipity</i>, a very expressive word," as
                    "discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things which
                    they were not in quest of."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pievani knows a lot, but like a <i>lot</i>, about the
                    history of science, and he puts it on display here. He
                    quickly debunks all of the instances of alleged serendipity
                    that are always trotted out: Fleming the microbiologist had
                    been studying antibiotics and searching for a commercially
                    viable one for years before his moldy plate led him to
                    penicillin. Yes, Röntgen discovered X-rays by a fluke, but
                    it was only because of the training he received in his
                    studies of cathode rays that he recognized he was observing
                    a new form of radiation. Plenty of people over the course of
                    history splashed some volume of water out of the baths they
                    were climbing into and watched apples fall, but only
                    Archimedes—who had recently been tasked by his king to
                    figure out if his crown was made entirely of gold—and
                    Newton—polymathic inventor of calculus—leapt from these
                    (probably apocryphal) mundane occurrences to their famous
                    discoveries of density and gravity, respectively.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After dispensing with these tired old saws, Pievani then
                    suggests some cases of potentially real—or strong, as he
                    deems it—serendipity. George de Mestral's inventing velcro
                    after noticing burrs stuck to his pants while hiking in the
                    Alps; he certainly wasn't searching for anything, and he
                    parlayed his observation into a useful technology. DuPont
                    chemists' developing nylon, Teflon, and Post-it notes while
                    playing with polymers for assorted other purposes. Columbus
                    "discovering" the Americas (for the fourth time) since he
                    thought the Earth was about a third smaller than
                    Eratosthenes of Cyrene had correctly calculated it to be
                    almost two thousand years earlier, forgotten "due to memory
                    loss and Eurocentric prejudices."

                The European Court of Justice has ruled that Apple has gotten an
                unfair tax advantage by the Irish tax authorities over the
                period 1991 to 2014.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this period, Apple only paid taxes in the European Union
                through 2 subsidiaries in Ireland, Apple Sales International and
                Apple Operations Europe. Both companies were granted exemption
                tax rules by the Irish government in 1991 and 2007. As a result
                of the allocation method endorsed in these tax rulings, Apple
                only paid an effective corporate tax rate that declined from 1%
                in 2003 to 0.005% in 2014 on the profits of Apple Sales
                International.
              </p>
              <p>
                This selective tax treatment of Apple in Ireland is illegal
                under EU state aid rules, because it gives Apple a significant
                advantage over other businesses that are subject to the normal
                national taxation rules, according to the European Commission.

                is correct, and Apple needs to pay illegal tax benefits worth
                €13 billion, plus rent, to the Irish authorities.
              </p>
              <p>There is no appeal possible to this decision.</p>

                    Wars of necessity spawn weapons innovation as each side
                    tries to counter the other's tactics and punch through
                    defenses. For instance—as the Russian invasion of Ukraine
                    has made drone warfare real, both sides have developed ways
                    to bring down drones more easily. One recent Ukrainian

                    In the case of the trench warfare that currently dominates
                    the Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainians have

                    (usually aluminum) and metal oxide (in this case, said to be
                    iron). When a thermite mixture is ignited, it undergoes a

                    about the new drones. The Dragon drones' "effectiveness now
                    looks much higher than in the initial videos," the writer
                    says, adding that they are "capable of burning out
                    vegetation (grass, bushes, trees with foliage) in a short
                    period of time. This will open up the enemy's view of
                    camouflaged positions, which will deprive the defending
                    units of property and ammunition, and the assault groups
                    concentrated for the attack of the element of surprise."

                    Researchers have discovered more than 280 malicious apps for
                    Android that use optical character recognition to steal
                    cryptocurrency wallet credentials from infected devices.

                    The apps masquerade as official ones from banks, government
                    services, TV streaming services, and utilities. In fact,
                    they scour infected phones for text messages, contacts, and
                    all stored images and surreptitiously send them to remote
                    servers controlled by the app developers. The apps are
                    available from malicious sites and are distributed in
                    phishing messages sent to targets. There's no indication

                    The most notable thing about the newly discovered malware
                    campaign is that the threat actors behind it are employing
                    optical character recognition software in an attempt to
                    extract cryptocurrency wallet credentials that are shown in
                    images stored on infected devices. Many wallets allow users
                    to protect their wallets with a series of random words. The
                    mnemonic credentials are easier for most people to remember
                    than the jumble of characters that appear in the private
                    key. Words are also easier for humans to recognize in
                    images.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Optical character recognition is the process of
                    converting images of typed, handwritten, or printed text
                    into machine-encoded text. OCR has existed for years and has
                    grown increasingly common to transform characters captured
                    in images into characters that can be read and manipulated
                    by software.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] People who are concerned they may have installed one
                    of the malicious apps should check the McAfee post for a
                    list of associated websites and cryptographic hashes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The malware has received multiple updates over time. Whereas
                    it once used HTTP to communicate with control servers, it
                    now connects through
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket"
                      >WebSockets</a
                    >, a mechanism that's harder for security software to parse.
                    WebSockets have the added benefit of being a more versatile
                    channel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Developers have also updated the apps to better obfuscate
                    their malicious functionality. Obfuscation methods include
                    encoding the strings inside the code so they're not easily
                    read by humans, the addition of irrelevant code, and the
                    renaming of functions and variables, all of which confuse
                    analysts and make detection harder. While the malware is
                    mostly restricted to South Korea, it has recently begun to
                    spread within the UK.
                  </p>

                    "This development is significant as it shows that the threat
                    actors are expanding their focus both demographically and
                    geographically," Ryu wrote. "The move into the UK points to
                    a deliberate attempt by the attackers to broaden their
                    operations, likely aiming at new user groups with localized
                    versions of the malware."

                    vehicles affordable for the middle class. Electric vehicles,
                    he has said, cost about 40% more than those powered by
                    gasoline. Without cost reductions, EVs will be too expensive
                    for the middle class, shrinking the market and driving costs
                    up more, Tavares has said.

                I've been working on cars for most of my life and my observation
                is Chrysler/Ram are the worst vehicles on the road. I also own
                two Jeeps that are 50+ years old, however Chrysler has ruined
                the Jeep name by what I assume is cutting corners to save money
                because they're poorly designed and flimsy. Interesting the
                powers that be at Stellantis don't seem to be concerned about
                these issues.

                    One issue in getting office buildings networked that you
                    don't typically face at home is concrete—and lots of it.
                    Concrete walls are an average of 8 inches thick inside most
                    commercial real estate.

                    Keeping a network running through them is not merely a
                    matter of running cord. Not everybody has the knowledge or
                    tools to punch through that kind of wall. Even if they do,
                    you can't just put a hole in something that might be
                    load-bearing or part of a fire control system without
                    imaging, permits, and contractors. The bandwidths that can
                    work through these walls, like 3G, are being phased out, and
                    the bandwidths that provide enough throughput for modern
                    systems, like 5G, can't make it through.

                    it can bend around corners, even 90 degrees. Your particular

                  <p>Before FM, There was APEX</p>
                  <p>
                    In the early and mid-1930s, radio communication was confined
                    to the Low [or Long] Waves (100-500 kHz), Medium Waves
                    (500-1500 kHz), and the Short Waves (1,500 to 30,000 kHz).
                    The frequencies above that, referred to as the "ultra-high
                    frequencies", were truly the "Wild West" of radio. It was a
                    place for experimentation and a possible home to future
                    radio services. Commercial broadcasting to the public took
                    place entirely on the standard broadcast band (540-1600
                    kHz), but it was affected by a number of defects that
                    annoyed the public – natural and man-made static, local and
                    skip interference, atmospheric fading, and limited fidelity.
                    Starting about 1932, a number of brave and daring
                    broadcasters sought permission from the FCC to conduct
                    experiments in the Ultra-Short Waves in an attempt to find
                    solutions to these problems. In particular, these
                    experimental stations wanted to transmit wideband, high
                    fidelity audio. Amplitude modulation, the only known method
                    of transmitting audio at the time, was the method utilized
                    on these so-called "Apex" stations. Experimental licenses
                    were being issued for up to 1,000 watts on frequencies at
                    25-26 MHz and 42 MHz. By 1939, these Apex stations were
                    operating in 34 U.S. cities in 22 states They suffered less
                    skip interference than standard AM stations, but static was
                    still a problem.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the same time that these Apex broadcasters were gaining a
                    foothold in the upper frontiers of the radio spectrum, an
                    entirely new type of radio service was also being
                    demonstrated - one that was destined to cause Apex AM to
                    become obsolete. That service was called Frequency
                    Modulation, or FM.

                <div>

                    [...] As Starliner approached the space station in June,
                    five of 28 control thrusters on Starliner's service module
                    failed, forcing Wilmore to take manual control as ground
                    teams sorted out the problem. Eventually, engineers
                    recovered four of the five thrusters, but NASA's decision
                    makers were unable to convince themselves the same problem
                    wouldn't reappear, or get worse, when the spacecraft
                    departed the space station and headed for reentry and
                    landing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Engineers later determined the control jets lost thrust due
                    to overheating, which can cause Teflon seals in valves to
                    swell and deform, starving the thrusters of propellant.
                    Telemetry data beamed back to the mission controllers from
                    Starliner showed higher-than-expected temperatures on two of
                    the service module thrusters during the flight back to Earth
                    Friday night, but they continued working.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The overheating thrusters are located inside four
                    doghouse-shaped propulsion pods around the perimeter of
                    Starliner's service module. It turns out the doghouses
                    retain heat like a thermos—something NASA and Boeing didn't
                    fully appreciate before this mission—and the thrusters don't
                    have time to cool down when the spacecraft fires its control
                    jets in rapid pulses. It might help if Boeing removes some
                    of the insulating thermal blankets from the doghouses, Stich
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The easiest method of resolving the problem of Starliner's
                    overheating thrusters would be to change the rate and
                    duration of thruster firings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "What we would like to do is try not to change the thruster.
                    I think that is the best path," Stich said. "There thrusters
                    have shown resilience and have shown that they perform well,
                    as long as we keep their temperatures down and don't fire
                    them in a manner that causes the temperatures to go up."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There's one thing from this summer's test flight that might,
                    counterintuitively, help NASA certify the Starliner
                    spacecraft to begin operational flights with its next
                    mission. Rather than staying at the space station for eight
                    days, Starliner remained docked at the research lab for
                    three months, half of the duration of a full-up crew
                    rotation flight. Despite the setbacks, Stich estimated the
                    test flight achieved about 85 to 90 percent of its
                    objectives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There's a lot of learning that happens in that three months
                    that is invaluable for an increment mission," Stich said.
                    "So, in some ways, the mission overachieved some objectives,
                    in terms of being there for extra time. Not having the crew
                    onboard, obviously, there are some things that we lack in
                    terms of Butch and Suni's test pilot expertise, and how the
                    vehicle performed, what they saw in the cockpit. We won't
                    have that data, but we still have the wealth of data from
                    the spacecraft itself, so that will go toward the mission
                    objectives and the certification."

                    If Chinese satellite broadband services are widely adopted,
                    Page thinks "the world may witness the rise of a new digital
                    Iron Curtain extending from space, dividing the free flow of
                    information and imposing state control on a global scale."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Which sounds terrifying. However, many nations are already
                    wary of satellite broadband, and are attempting to regulate
                    it like any other telco. China's telcos and networking
                    equipment providers have already been banned in many
                    nations, while Beijing's various diplomatic efforts are
                    increasingly regarded with scepticism after they left
                    countries like Sri Lanka and Zambia in deep debt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With US-based satellite broadband providers like Starlink
                    and Amazon's Kuiper likely to offer service that matches the
                    performance of Chinese providers, nations will have an easy
                    way to route around Beijing's network controls. That is, if
                    they are applied to satellite internet – a circumstance
                    about which Page speculates, but which is not certain to
                    eventuate.
