                    Federal investigators have discovered a second contaminant
                    in recalled applesauce pouches — the naturally-occurring
                    metal chromium, which in a certain form can cause a number
                    of adverse health effects.

                    investigation of high levels of lead found in cinnamon
                    applesauce pouches marketed to children. The pouches of
                    fruit puree that have been recalled were manufactured in
                    Ecuador and sold under the brand names WanaBana, Schnucks
                    and Weis. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and

                  <p>
                    The FDA has reported finding extraordinarily high levels of
                    lead in samples of cinnamon from the Ecuador plant where the
                    pouches were made. On Friday, the agency reported it had
                    also found chromium. Chromium is an
                    <a
                      href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/chromium/"
                      >essential mineral</a
                    >
                    found in foods and dietary supplements, but in one form —
                    called chromium-6 — it can cause harm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Lead chromate, which contains the potentially toxic
                    chromium-6, has been used in the past to enhance the
                    coloring of
                    <a
                      href="https://stanmed.stanford.edu/turmeric-lead-risk-detect/"
                      >turmeric</a
                    >. Federal investigators say the "lead-to-chromium ratio" in
                    the applesauce pouches "is consistent with that of lead
                    chromate."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] But investigators said the chromium in lead chromate
                    may be converted to the less toxic form chromium-3, "due to
                    the acidity of the applesauce and the stomach."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Michael Beuhler, the medical director of North Carolina
                    Poison Control, said the discovery of chromium in the
                    applesauce and cinnamon does not necessarily mean the
                    substance will cause harm. He said that "at the levels we're
                    talking about," he doesn't believe there would be much
                    chromium-6 in the pouches. Any chromium-6 that might have
                    been present would probably reduce to a nontoxic form once
                    inside the applesauce pouches, he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He said lead chromate could have been added as a powder to
                    cinnamon to affect the weight and color of the spice. Lead
                    chromate can be more than six times heavier than cinnamon,
                    he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I don't believe that this is any cause for additional
                    alarm," Beuhler said. "But it does suggest why it happened."

                    Anyone following the fusion news out of LLNL knows that,
                    while the X-ray beam that hit the fusion fuel pellet – a
                    diamond-encased, pea sized lump of deuterium and tritium –
                    may have delivered 2.05 megajoules of energy to the pellet
                    and produced 3.15 megajoules, it took far more energy than
                    that to get the whole thing accomplished.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fuel pellet sits inside a cylindrical chamber known as a
                    hohlraum, which converts laser energy into X-rays that
                    ignite the pellet. Those lasers output 322 megajoules of
                    energy – all but 2.05 mj of which is lost in the conversion
                    to X-rays. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In essence, Edwards said, the whole system only has an
                    efficiency of around 1 percent, but that could change in
                    2024.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For starters, using laser fusion to generate power
                    means shooting fuel pellets somewhere in the neighborhood of
                    one to ten times every second – instead of once a month like
                    the NIF.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That means mass production of targets, a method of
                    extracting energy from said targets, and a reliable method
                    of scaling the entire system. In other words, developing an
                    entire framework for an integrated fusion plant – which will
                    be a major part of LLNL's work in the coming year and
                    beyond. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We're looking at the emergence of a new public sector,"
                    Edwards enthused. "I'm really excited about this." 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] So keep an eye open for more breakthroughs in 2024 –
                    provided Congress gets its act together.

                  <p>
                    At a recent RSA Security Conference, Nico Sell was on stage
                    announcing that her company—Wickr—was making drastic changes
                    to ensure its users' security. She said that the company
                    would switch from RSA encryption to
                    <a
                      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman"
                      >elliptic curve encryption</a
                    >, and that the service wouldn't have a backdoor for anyone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As she left the stage, before she'd even had a chance to
                    take her microphone off, a man approached her and introduced
                    himself as an agent with the Federal Bureau of
                    Investigation. He then proceeded to "casually" ask if she'd
                    be willing to install a backdoor into Wickr that would allow
                    the FBI to retrieve information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This encounter, and the agent's casual demeanor, is
                    apparently business as usual as intelligence and law
                    enforcement agencies seek to gain greater access into
                    protected communication systems. Since her encounter with
                    the agent at RSA, Sell says it's a story she's heard again
                    and again. "It sounds like that's how they do it now," she
                    told SecurityWatch. "Always casual, testing, because most
                    people would say yes."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It was clear that the FBI agent didn't know who he was
                    dealing with, because Sell did not back down. Instead, she
                    lectured him on topics ranging from the First and Fourth
                    Amendments to the Constitution, to George Washington's
                    creation of a Post Office in the US. "My ancestor was a
                    drummer boy under Washington," Sell explained. "Washington
                    thought it was very important to have freedom of information
                    and private correspondence without government surveillance."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Her lecture concluded, she proceeded to grill the agent. "I
                    asked if he had official paperwork for me, if this was an
                    official request, who his boss was," said Sell. "He backed
                    down very quickly."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Though she didn't budge for the agent, Sell makes it clear
                    that surveillance and security is a complicated issue. "Ten
                    years ago, I'd have said yes," said Sell. "Because if law
                    enforcement asks you to catch bad guys, who wouldn't want to
                    help?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The difference now, she explained, was her experiences at
                    BlackHat. Among those, Sell pointed to a BlackHat event
                    where
                    <a
                      href="http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-10/Cross_Tom/BlackHat-DC-2010-Cross-Attacking-LawfulI-Intercept-wp.pdf"

                    >
                    how to break into lawful intercept machines—or wiretaps. "It
                    was very clear that a backdoor for the good guys is always a
                    backdoor for the bad guys."

                    Most message apps tout their privacy features in some way.
                    It is common to hear marketing language about "end-to-end
                    encryption" and "private messaging" for basically every
                    communications app out there.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While it's great that encryption has become a selling point
                    for the public, not every "encrypted messaging service" is
                    made equally. Depending on how it is set up, your message
                    app may leak metadata, contacts, and even message contents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A recently uncovered FBI document obtained by a group called
                    Property of the People and shared with Rolling Stone
                    illustrates just how important your choice of private
                    messenger can be. If you think popular options like Apple's
                    iMessage and the Meta company formerly known as Facebook's
                    WhatsApp are FBI-proof, think again. The nation's top cops
                    can obtain a host of message information on many popular
                    options including some mix of "subscriber data, message
                    sender-receiver data, device backup, IP address, encryption
                    keys, date/time information, registration time data, and
                    user contacts."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Nine popular messaging applications are included in
                    the document: Apple's iMessage; Line, a Japanese message
                    app; Signal, an open source encrypted chat platform
                    popularized by Edward Snowden; Telegram, which originated in
                    Russia and is now based in Dubai; Threema, a paid encryption
                    chat (that I used to use) with servers based in Switzerland;
                    Viber, which was developed in Cyprus and then bought by the
                    Japanese conglomerate Rakuten; the Chinese Swiss army knife
                    app WeChat; Meta's WhatsApp; and Wickr [Me], which is a chat
                    service that Amazon Web Services apparently owns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The bottom line: of the most popular apps, iMessage and
                    WhatsApp are particularly susceptible to FBI snooping.
                    Telegram and Signal score far better according to the FBI
                    documents. (Line and Viber are also relatively bad picks,
                    and my formerly favored Threema likewise fares more poorly
                    than I'd have expected, but since they aren't as popular
                    this probably isn't relevant for you.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Now to the encryption winners. It's no surprise that
                    Signal fared well against favored FBI methods. It's open
                    source, independent (albeit with some surprising
                    partnerships), and touted by public personalities with
                    privacy-focused bonafides. Still, I would have expected the
                    FBI to have access to more metadata than they apparently do.
                    Way to go, Signal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Telegram especially surprised me for scoring so well.
                    End-to-end encryption is not the default for most Telegram
                    communications. You need to select a "secret chat" with an
                    individual to get the full-bodied protection that the FBI
                    document seems to indicate. Groups chats, which is the
                    method preferred of many Telegram users, do not offer the
                    same level of end-to-end encryption. Neither the FBI
                    document nor the Rolling Stone article makes mention of
                    this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Weirdly, Rolling Stone does not mention Telegram at all,
                    despite being the apparently most FBI-proof application all
                    around and much more popular than Wickr, which does get a
                    nod. The FBI document does note that Telegram may choose to
                    divulge IP addresses and phone numbers for "confirmed
                    terrorist investigations," but it cites Telegram's public
                    policy rather than any secret backchannel.

                    saying the company would be grounding its fleet of 65 Boeing
                    737-9 aircraft for what it expects to be a few days as it
                    conducts safety checks. “Each aircraft will be returned to
                    service only after completion of full maintenance and safety
                    inspections,” Minicucci. The FAA order extends the grounding
                    to “approximately 171 airplanes worldwide” that are either
                    operated by US airlines or in US territory.

                    Minicucci also said that the National Transportation Safety
                    Board is investigating what happened with Flight 1282 and
                    “we will fully support their investigation.” The plane had
                    been on its way to Ontario, California.

                    One of the greatest challenges of modern physics is to find
                    a coherent method for describing phenomena, on the cosmic
                    and microscale. For over a hundred years, to describe
                    reality on a cosmic scale we have been using general
                    relativity theory, which has successfully undergone repeated
                    attempts at falsification.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Albert Einstein curved space-time to describe gravity, and
                    despite still-open questions about dark matter or dark
                    energy, it seems, today, to be the best method of analyzing
                    the past and future of the universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To describe phenomena on the scale of atoms, we use the
                    second great theory: quantum mechanics, which differs from
                    general relativity in basically everything. It uses flat
                    space-time and a completely different mathematical
                    apparatus, and most importantly, perceives reality radically
                    differently.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the quantum description, the phenomena around us are only
                    wavering probabilities of events that we can only measure
                    with limited accuracy.
                  </p>

                    that there is a method that combines the above descriptions,
                    although it leads to quite a surprising conclusion.

                  <p>
                    India's science and technology minister Jitendra Singh said
                    on social media that the probe had reached its final orbit
                    "to discover the mysteries of Sun-Earth connection".

                    [...] But the latest mission by the Indian Space Research
                    Organization is the first by any Asian nation to be placed

                    only one percent of the distance between humanity's home
                    planet and the star at the center of our solar system.

                    It is now at a point where the gravitational forces of both
                    celestial bodies cancel out, allowing it to remain in a
                    stable halo orbit around the Sun.

                    The orbiter, which reportedly cost $48 million, will study
                    coronal mass ejections, a periodic phenomenon that sees huge
                    discharges of plasma and magnetic energy from the Sun's

                    since it first sent a probe to orbit the Moon in 2008.

                  <p>
                    In August last year, India became the first country to land
                    an uncrewed craft near the largely unexplored lunar south
                    pole, and just the fourth nation to land on the Moon.

                  <p>
                    India became the first Asian nation to put a craft into
                    orbit around Mars in 2014, and it is slated to launch a

                    CES is about more than just the gadgets you hold in your
                    hand or sit at the desk to use. It's about the stuff in your
                    bathroom, too, which is why Kohler is using the annual trade
                    show to debut its latest in connected fixtures. The new
                    items include a new shower sprayer, a ventilation fan that
                    helps with humidity after a long shower, and my favorite,
                    the PureWash Bidet Seat with Google and Alexa built-in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The PureWash Bidet Seat is as standard as any other, but I
                    like that you can talk to it. It's heated, has adjustable
                    temperatures and water pressure, and comes in white or black
                    to match your bathroom style. It also features voice
                    activation via Amazon's Alexa or the Google Assistant. You
                    can use your voice to command the spray pressure and the air
                    dryer—it has a dryer! Ahhh, nice and warm.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Kohler will have other fixtures on display at CES,
                    including the Rista, a 3D-printed sink. I also hope to
                    glimpse the new Anthem+ Smart Showering controls, which
                    offer remote access to lights, water, and sound through the
                    Kohler Konnect app.

                    For now, Steam might continue to work with these older
                    operating systems. Valve announced the retirement as its

                    still supported as Microsoft will keep rolling out security

                      Two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting materials have proved
                      to be very promising for the development of various
                      electronic devices, including wearables and smaller
                      electronics. These materials can have significant
                      advantages over their bulky counterparts, for instance
                      retaining their carrier mobility irrespective of their
                      reduced thickness.

                      Despite their promise for creating thin electronics, 2D
                      semiconductors have so far only rarely been used to create
                      monolayer transistors, thinner versions of the crucial
                      electronic components used to modulate and amplify
                      electrical current inside most existing devices. Most
                      proposed monolayer transistors based on 2D semiconductors
                      were created using a few carefully selected materials
                      known to have relatively stable lattice structures, such
                      as graphene, tungsten diselenide or molybdenum disulfide
                      (MoS2).

                      Researchers at Hunan University, the Chinese Academy of
                      Sciences and Wuhan University recently set out to develop
                      new monolayer transistors using alternative 2D
                      semiconducting materials that have so far been primarily
                      used to create multi-layer transistors, including black
                      phosphorus (BP) and germanium arsenide (GeAs). Their work
                      is published in the journal Nature Electronics.

                    <p>
                      "For a number of promising 2D materials—such as black
                      phosphorus and germanium arsenide—the fabrication of
                      monolayer transistors is challenging and is limited by the
                      difficulties in forming robust electrical contacts with
                      the delicate 2D materials," Wangying Li, Quanyang Tao and
                      their colleagues wrote in their paper. "We report the
                      fabrication of monolayer black phosphorus and germanium
                      arsenide transistors with three-dimensional raised
                      contacts using a van der Waals peeling technique."

                      The primary objective of the recent work by this team of
                      researchers was to create new transistors based on
                      monolayer 2D semiconductors beyond those that have so far
                      been primarily used in monolayer transistor designs. This
                      presents several challenges, as some of these materials
                      are difficult to scale down uniformly and without
                      compromising their intrinsic properties.

                      [...] Though the Romans consumed even more wine than we do
                      today, ancient vineyards in Italy looked radically
                      different from the typical landscape of rolling hillsides
                      covered by rows of tightly spaced vines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      [...] But the sophistication of the system goes much
                      further. By training vines to climb high—up to 15 or even
                      20 meters—the damage done by rising soil dampness was
                      further reduced, while the heating impact of the sun was
                      increased. This made grapes develop and mature better, as
                      long as the right balance between shade (from foliage) and
                      sun exposure was obtained. High climbing vines also have
                      deeper and more developed roots, which makes them more
                      resistant to rot caused by parasites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Examples in pre industrial Portugal also show that the
                      trees themselves even contribute to the microclimate of
                      the vineyard: they mitigate the impact of winter frosts,
                      offer protection against strong and damaging winds, and
                      reduce the distribution of unwanted seeds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Records show that vine agroforestery expanded massively
                      between the years 200 BC and 200 AD, during what is known
                      as the Roman Climate Optimum, a period of several
                      centuries of markedly warmer temperatures that coincided
                      with the expansion of the Roman Empire. This means that
                      Roman winemakers in Italy often operated under warmer and
                      more humid conditions than those experienced in much of
                      the 20th century.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      [...] Insights into Roman and pre-industrial practices
                      suggest that this approach may also help winemakers to
                      adapt to an ever-warming planet. It also begs the much
                      wider question of what else we can learn by looking to the
                      past as we confront an uncertain future.

                    On Monday, January 8, United Launch Alliance's Vulcan
                    Centaur could finally perform its first flight. ULA has been
                    a rock in the spaceflight industry since its founding in
                    2006, and with this pending launch, the company is ready to
                    take its next bold step into space. Here's how America's new
                    powerhouse rocket could disrupt the sector and compete with
                    the ever-dominant SpaceX.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Vulcan Centaur rocket, towering at 202 feet (61.6
                    meters), is scheduled for liftoff from Cape Canaveral's
                    Space Launch Complex-41. ULA, a collaboration between
                    Lockheed Martin Corporation and Boeing Company, hasn't
                    created a rocket that compares technologically to those
                    belonging to SpaceX, but it still represents a big
                    achievement for the company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Vulcan Centaur could make serious waves in the spaceflight
                    industry, with

                      >ULA potentially matching SpaceX's lower launch prices</a
                    >, according to the Motley Fool. SpaceX, known for
                    revolutionizing space travel with affordable launches like
                    the $67 million Falcon 9, prompted ULA to respond with a
                    more affordable option. Vulcan, set to launch at under $100
                    million, marks a substantial cost reduction from the
                    company's $400 million Delta IV Heavy. This strategic
                    pricing means ULA can stay somewhat competitive,
                    demonstrated by its
                    <a
                      href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/01/space-force-awards-spacex-ula-with-2point5-billion-for-21-launches.html"

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While this might mean lower revenues for Boeing and Lockheed
                    Martin, the Vulcan Centaur's cost-effectiveness could prove
                    beneficial in the long term. This development
                    signals—hopefully—a tightening competition in the space
                    launch sector. What's more, customers must weigh other
                    considerations beyond just launch costs, such as fairing
                    adaptability and the increasing issue of backlogs. Needless
                    to say, the introduction of SpaceX's Starship megarocket
                    could complicate the landscape for ULA, but only time will
                    tell.

                needed to reach a skill level where one can play as long as
                endurance and the software hold out. In his case it took over
                half an hour on the NES using rolling:

                    Blue Scuti is a Tetris prodigy who employs the "rolling"
                    controller technique, a new way of holding and using the NES
                    controller that was popularized in 2021. Rolling surpassed
                    "hyper tapping," which requires players to tap the
                    controller's D-pad 12 times per second, as the fastest and
                    best way of playing Tetris. Rolling is a method where
                    players roll their fingers on the bottom of an NES
                    controller and use that pressure to push the controller into
                    their other hand, which presses the D-pad to move the
                    blocks. With rolling, players can push the D-pad at least 20
                    times per second, which is fast enough to theoretically play
                    the game until it breaks. The technique has completely
                    revolutionized competitive Tetris over the last few years.

                    Rocket and satellite maker SpaceX on Wednesday was accused
                    by a U.S. labor agency of unlawfully firing eight employees
                    for circulating a letter calling founder and CEO Elon Musk a
                    "distraction and embarrassment."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A regional official with the National Labor Relations Board
                    (NLRB) issued a complaint claiming SpaceX violated the
                    workers' rights under federal labor law to band together and
                    advocate for better working conditions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The letter sent to SpaceX executives in June 2022 focused on
                    a series of tweets Musk had made since 2020, many of which
                    were sexually suggestive.

                    >
                    Musk's statements did not align with the company's policies
                    on diversity and workplace misconduct, and called on SpaceX
                    to condemn them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The complaint also accuses SpaceX of interrogating employees
                    about the letter, disparaging the workers who were involved,
                    and threatening to fire workers who engaged in similar
                    activity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The case is the latest to accuse companies run by Musk
                    of violating employees' rights under labor and employment
                    laws.

                    An incredibly early release of 86-DOS has been found,
                    imaged, and shared on the Internet Archive. The disk appears
                    to be an original release of version 0.1 C of 86-DOS from
                    Seattle Computer Products (1980) and includes several
                    utilities, along with a game. Moreover, according to the
                    disk label, what we see is just the eleventh disk off the
                    duplication line. This is an important finding, as 86-DOS is
                    a direct ancestor of PC DOS and MS-DOS.

                    on the Internet Archive’s site just ahead of the New Year.
                     We even get to see a photo of the disk in its paper sleeve,
                    where “Serial #11” can be seen printed. Before this 86-DOS
                    release was unearthed on its 5.25-inch floppy disk, the
                    earliest version that had been saved for posterity was
                    version 0.34.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] NTDEV highlights the Spartan nature of 86-DOS version
                    0.1 C. The OS is delivered as a floppy disk containing just
                    nine files. The core OS standard COMMAND.COM was included,
                    which interprets command line instructions like dir, copy,
                    clear, and format. The disk also contained utilities for
                    file and disk copying, a basic text editor, plus two or
                    three development utilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The development utilities were important to 86-DOS releases
                    as users would be short on software unless they sourced or
                    translated existing 8-bit Z80 CP/M programs for the 8086
                    architecture. Thus, there was an assembly language program
                    called ASM.COM, a code compiler app called HEX2BIN.COM, and
                    a Z80 to 8086 translator dubbed TRANS.COM.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last but not least, it is interesting to see that an OS as
                    primitive as this release included a game. CHESS.COM was
                    accompanied by instructions in CHESS.DOC, which would
                    probably be essential reading on a no-graphics rendition of
                    this complex strategic game.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To test 86-DOS yourself, you can grab the disk image
                    directly from Archive.org and then follow the instructions

                    [...] Arrow worms are one of the oldest animal fossils from
                    the Cambrian. While arthropods appear in the fossil record
                    about 521 to 529 million years ago, arrow worms can be
                    traced back at least 538 million years back in time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr. Vinther explained, "Both arrow worms, and the more
                    primitive Timorebestia, were swimming predators. We can
                    therefore surmise that in all likelihood they were the
                    predators that dominated the oceans before arthropods took
                    off. Perhaps they had a dynasty of about 10–15 million years
                    before they got superseded by other, and more successful,
                    groups."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Our discovery firms up how arrow worms evolved,"
                    added Tae Yoon Park from the Korean Polar Research
                    Institute, the other senior author and field expedition
                    leader. "Living arrow worms have a distinct nervous center
                    on their belly, called a ventral ganglion. It is entirely
                    unique to these animals."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We are very excited to have discovered such unique
                    predators in Sirius Passet. Over a series of expeditions to
                    the very remote Sirius Passet in the furthest reaches of
                    North Greenland, more than 82,5˚ north, we have collected a
                    great diversity of exciting new organisms. Thanks to the
                    remarkable, exceptional preservation in Sirius Passet, we
                    can also reveal exciting anatomical details, including their
                    digestive system, muscle anatomy, and nervous systems."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We have many more exciting findings to share in the coming
                    years that will help show how the earliest animal ecosystems
                    looked like and evolved," Dr. Park concluded.

                    disaster, 23andMe has apparently decided to leave its
                    customers out to dry while downplaying the seriousness of
                    these events," Hassan Zavareei, one of the lawyers
                    representing the victims who received the letter from
                    23andMe, told TechCrunch in an email.

                    "users negligently recycled and failed to update their
                    passwords following these past security incidents, which are
                    unrelated to 23andMe."

                  <p>
                    "Therefore, the incident was not a result of 23andMe's
                    alleged failure to maintain reasonable security measures,"
                    the letter reads.

                  <p>
                    Zavareei said that 23andMe is "shamelessly" blaming the
                    victims of the data breach.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This finger pointing is nonsensical. 23andMe knew or should
                    have known that many consumers use recycled passwords and
                    thus that 23andMe should have implemented some of the many
                    safeguards available to protect against credential stuffing
                    — especially considering that 23andMe stores personal
                    identifying information, health information, and genetic
                    information on its platform," Zavareei said in an email.

                    "The breach impacted millions of consumers whose data was
                    exposed through the DNA Relatives feature on 23andMe's
                    platform, not because they used recycled passwords. Of those
                    millions, only a few thousand accounts were compromised due
                    to credential stuffing. 23andMe's attempt to shirk
                    responsibility by blaming its customers does nothing for
                    these millions of consumers whose data was compromised
                    through no fault of their own whatsoever," said Zavareei.

                I'm not one of these Nancy-Boys who just downloads some binaries
                and call it an operating system. I compiled my Gentoo, right
                here on my own computer, but now that's history.
              </p>
              <p>
                In what many thought might be a prank, The geeks at Gentoo
                announced they will now offers 20-plus gigabytes of pre-compiled
                binaries, from desktops to office suites, to speed up
                installations and updates.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although this is exactly how basically all other current Linux
                distributions work, it is a significant departure for Gentoo,
                which previously was an almost entirely source-based distro.
                With Gentoo, the install disk that gets you started must by
                definition be pre-compiled, up to now, when you install Gentoo,
                it fetches the source code and compiles it on your machine for
                your machine, specifically optimized for your computer's
                specific CPU and the individual functionality and configuration
                you chose.
              </p>
              <p>
                For now, the full range of pre-compiled binary packages will
                focus on x86-64 and Arm64.

                    Researchers have taken a big step forward in the quest to
                    regenerate the pancreatic beta-cells damaged by type 1
                    diabetes. Using FDA-approved drugs usually given to patients
                    with rare cancers, they reprogrammed pancreatic cells to
                    produce and secrete insulin in response to glucose. The
                    discovery could mean that, one day, diabetics won't need to
                    take multiple daily insulin injections.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pancreatic beta-cells synthesize, store and release insulin.
                    But, in type 1 diabetes (T1D), the immune system selectively
                    destroys these cells over time, leading to a lifelong
                    dependence on exogenous insulin administration for survival.
                    While insulin therapy helps control blood glucose, it
                    doesn't prevent, stop, or reverse the destruction of the
                    pancreas' insulin-secreting cells.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For many years, research has focused on identifying novel
                    therapies that stimulate beta-cell growth and function to
                    restore insulin production in type 1 diabetics. Now, in an
                    exciting breakthrough, researchers at the Baker Heart and
                    Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia, have brought us
                    a step closer to making this a reality, regenerating damaged
                    pancreatic cells so they can produce insulin and
                    functionally respond to blood glucose levels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We consider this regenerative approach an important advance
                    towards clinical development," said Sam El-Osta, the study's
                    corresponding author. "Until now, the regenerative process
                    has been incidental and lacking confirmation; more
                    importantly, the epigenetic mechanisms that govern such
                    regeneration in humans remains poorly understood."
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    ductal progenitor cells, descendants of stem cells, into
                    beta-like cells capable of producing insulin. Ductal cells
                    are exocrine cells that form the lining of the tubes (ducts)
                    that deliver pancreatic enzymes.

                    Digitization has many downsides. It puts many people at a
                    disadvantage and relegates them to the sidelines. Many
                    service providers apparently are unaware of this, or
                    consciously accept it. It disadvantages many weaker,
                    disabled, and older people. Digital devices are often more
                    difficult to use than analog ones. The more (mostly unused)
                    options, the more difficult it is.

                    The analog landline telephone is easy to use and works even
                    in the event of a power failure. Countless people are
                    overwhelmed by digital cell phones. Digitization excludes
                    many people from social or economic life. They are left
                    behind. Without computer skills, it is difficult to use
                    ticket machines, for example. Analog coffee machines,
                    washing machines, stoves, and refrigerators are more
                    user-friendly than digital ones. This is especially true for
                    radios and televisions.

                    anything that operates in this way, so it is unique in its
                    chemical makeup and mechanism of action."

                    While he stressed that this molecule alone would not solve
                    the public health threat of antimicrobial resistant
                    infections, the discovery could lay the foundations for
                    future efforts to drug the same transport system in other
                    bacteria.

                    [...] It is here that the nature of AI may hint at a
                    regulatory foothold in responsibly integrating machines with
                    the affairs of humanity. There is not just one AI, there are
                    multitudes of models, of hardware platforms, of approaches,
                    of experiments. They are machines, and we can make as many
                    as we need. Ultimate truth is ultimately unknowable, but a
                    workable consensus is achievable – or even a workable
                    majority.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you have a critical task where an AI is involved and
                    there's no way to immediately spot a blooper, get another
                    one in parallel. And another. Compare answers. If you can't
                    find enough independent AI for a particular problem, don't
                    use AI until you can.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Redundancy is a powerful weapon against error. Apollo got to
                    the Moon not because the systems were perfect, but because
                    they had redundancy in place in the expectation of failure.
                    The Soviet manned lunar effort eschewed that in favor of
                    what looked like expediency, but ended in ignominy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We don't have to trust AI, which is just as well – what is
                    truth? It knows no more than we do. But we have fashioned a
                    workable society around systems that trust and verify, and
                    we see this working in judges as well as jet planes. The
                    philosophy, potential, and pitfalls of our increasingly
                    thoughtful companions will work out over time, we should
                    just set the odds in our favor while we can. Whatever we do,
                    we won't be able to wash our hands of it.

                    [...] Google recently settled a similar antitrust case. The

                      href="https://bgr.com/business/google-to-pay-700m-antitrust-settlement-plus-changes-are-coming-to-the-play-store/"

                      works</a
                    >. Google will have to let Android users install apps from
                    any source. That’s what sideloading and third-party app
                    stores amount to.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google will also support third-party payment systems.
                    However, the company will still collect a fee from
                    developers for each transaction. And developers might not
                    end up saving that much money, if anything, by offering apps
                    through third-party repositories instead of the Play Store.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Antitrust case aside, I think Apple would be better
                    served by getting ahead of all this. Universal iPhone
                    sideloading support will happen eventually. Resisting it
                    only hurts the company at this point.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the end of the day, it will be up to the users to decide
                    whether to install apps from third parties. In the long run,
                    I don’t think Apple’s App Store bottom line will see a big
                    impact. Not as long as I, and others like me, continue to
                    avoid iPhone sideloading and all the risks that it entails.

                    The biggest problem with email addresses as 'permanent'
                    identifiers is that people's email addresses change even
                    within a single organization (for example, a university).
                    They change for the same collection of reasons that people's
                    commonly used names and logins change. An organization that
                    refuses to change or redo the email addresses it assigns to
                    people is being unusually cruel in ways that are probably
                    not legally sustainable in any number of places.

                    In a nutshell: Mozilla is seemingly on a journey to change
                    the internet again, but it will not get there with Firefox.
                    The open-source browser is barely mentioned throughout the
                    company's latest corporate manifesto, where AI algorithms
                    have become the real focus of the show.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the recently published
                    <a href="https://stateof.mozilla.org/"
                      >State of Mozilla for 2023</a
                    >, the open-source foundation made some bold statements
                    about its plans for the future. The organization aims to
                    build a better internet "by the people, for the people,"
                    countering the overwhelming influence of Big Tech
                    corporations with open data and AI services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The updated State of Mozilla is essentially designed to be a
                    company manifesto written in corporate lingo but it also
                    comes with the latest financial statements related to 2022
                    results, providing some interesting food for thought about
                    how and where the organization is spending its money.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mozilla's CEO, Mitchell Baker, received a substantial
                    compensation increase, as stated in the document, going from
                    $5,591,406 (2021) to $6,903,089 in 2022. Baker mentioned
                    that the organization is clearly moving in the right
                    direction but needs to do more and have a larger impact on
                    the market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Mozilla's CEO is being paid a lot more while Firefox
                    keeps losing users, and someone has
                    <a
                      href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5053290/mozilla-2023-annual-report-ceo-pay-skyrockets-while-firefox-marketshare-nosedives"
                      >suggested</a
                    >
                    that the organization's plan is now to fully transition away
                    from the open-source browser. Mozilla is increasing its pile
                    of financial assets, and Baker has clearly stated that the
                    organization is ready to make "difficult choices" when it
                    comes to shutting down unprofitable projects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, what future is Mozilla trying to build for itself and
                    internet users? The foundation is pushing the idea of a
                    trustworthy AI, improved ML algorithms with rich data, and
                    privacy prioritization. Mozilla still wants to put people
                    ahead of profit, the company's CEO said, but also take more
                    risks and move quickly in the growing AI market.

                    "Fog involves a lot of physics processes so it requires a
                    computer model that can better represent all these
                    processes," Pu said. "Because fog is clouds near the ground,
                    it requires a high-resolution model to resolve it, so we
                    need models at a very fine scale, which are computationally
                    very expensive. The current models (relatively coarser in
                    resolution) are not capable of resolving the fog processes,
                    and we need to improve the models for better fog
                    prediction."

                    A security report can take away a developer from fixing a
                    really annoying bug. because a security issue is always more
                    important than other bugs. If the report turned out to be
                    crap, we did not improve security and we missed out time on
                    fixing bugs or developing a new feature. Not to mention how
                    it drains you on energy having to deal with rubbish.

                Often wannabe security consultants will take the output of an
                LLM and modify it with their own language, thus intentionally or
                unintentionally obscuring some of the telltale warning signs of
                LLM-generated bunk.

                    of the world aren't so lucky. Samsung is still reeling from

                    The condition - which around 70,000 people in the UK are
                    thought to be living with - is when symptoms of dementia
                    develop before the age of 65.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study challenges the notion that genetics are the sole
                    cause of the condition, researchers have said.

                    Targeting the factors they identified could help reduce the

                    A list of 15 factors - which is similar to that for
                    late-onset dementia - includes alcohol abuse, stroke, social
                    isolation and hearing impairment.

                  <p>
                    Those with a higher formal education were seen to be at less
                    of a risk.

                  <p>
                    The study "breaks new ground" and could "herald a new era"
                    for interventions to reduce new cases, said Dr Janice
                    Ranson, one of the study's authors.

                    The most common feature of dementia is memory loss, but
                    other symptoms include changes in behaviour, and becoming
                    lost in familiar places.

                    [...] Prof Llewellyn said there was still much to learn but
                    the study "reveals that we may be able to take action to
                    reduce risk of this debilitating condition".

                    about the pirate accent: "Aaarr matey!" That accent we think
                    of comes from the actor Robert Newton who played Long John
                    Silver in the 1950 film

                    the end of the day, pirates were sailors. People ask about
                    what they wore, what they ate, thinking it's somehow
                    different. But the reality is it was the same as other
                    sailors. They might have had better clothes and better food
                    because of how often they robbed other ships.

                    <strong>Rebecca Simon</strong>: There were several reasons
                    why piracy really began to die down in the 1720s. One was an
                    increase in the Royal Navy presence so the seas were a lot
                    more heavily patrolled and it was becoming more difficult to
                    make a living as a pirate. Colonial governors and colonists
                    were no longer supporting pirates the way they once had, so
                    a lot of pirates were now losing their alliances and
                    protections. A lot of major pirate leaders who had been

                    It was just becoming too risky. And by 1730 a lot more wars
                    were breaking out, which required people who could sail and
                    fight. Pirates were offered pardons if they agreed to become
                    a privateer, basically a government-sanctioned mercenary at
                    sea where they were contracted to attack specific enemies.
                    As payment they got to keep about 80 percent of what they
                    stole. A lot of pirates decided that was more lucrative and
                    more stable.

              <p>Are SSBs Still Useful?</p>
              <p>
                Had SSBs come into existence in the mid-1990s when the Internet
                first became popular, they would have been a valuable tool for
                those trying to grasp the difference between between local
                applications and online resources. But nearly a quarter of the
                way into the 21st century, complete newcomers to computers are a
                much smaller minority than they once were. After trying Ice and
                Kumo for a week, I found SSBs convenient, but remain uncertain
                whether to make them a standard tool on my desktop. While SSBs
                make for a better user experience, is their efficiency that much
                more efficient than the dichotomy I lived with years? For better
                or worse, like most people, I am used to the dichotomy and it
                would be inefficient to change, even for a more economical
                arrangement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps SSBs make more sense on a network or in a business where
                their isolation provides another layer of security. Or perhaps
                the time for SSBs is past and there's a reason browsers have
                tried to implement them, and then discarded them.

                    During the pandemic, a third of people in the UK reported
                    that their trust in science had increased,
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0278169"
                      >we recently discovered.</a
                    >
                    But 7% said that it had decreased. Why is there such variety
                    of responses?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For many years, it was thought that the main reason some
                    people reject science was a simple deficit of knowledge and
                    a mooted(*) fear of the unknown. Consistent with this, many
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662506070159"
                      >surveys reported</a
                    >
                    that attitudes to science are more positive among those
                    people who know more of the textbook science.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But if that were indeed the core problem, the remedy would
                    be simple: inform people about the facts. This strategy,
                    which dominated science communication through much of the
                    later part of the 20th century, has, however,
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/097172180901400202"

                    change attitudes. And in the UK, scientific messaging over
                    genetically modified technologies has even backfired.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Recent evidence has revealed that people who reject or
                    distrust science are not especially well informed about it,
                    but more importantly, they typically believe that they do
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0520-3"

                  <p>
                    [...] A common quandary for much science communication may
                    in fact be that it appeals to those already engaged with
                    science. Which may be why you read this.

                  <p>
                    That said, the new science of communication suggests it is
                    certainly worth trying to reach out to those who are
                    disengaged.

                    To better understand this shift from belief to disbelief and
                    children's experiences of it, Mills and her colleagues
                    interviewed 48 six- to 15-year-olds who had stopped
                    believing in Santa and 44 of their parents, plus a further
                    383 adults.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The<a href="https://osf.io/3hyxa"> research</a>, which has
                    not yet been peer reviewed, found that for most children,
                    disbelief crept in gradually about the age of eight –
                    although some three- or four-year-olds had convinced
                    themselves that Santa wasn't real, while other children
                    believed in him until they were 15 or 16. In many cases, it
                    was testimony from other disbelievers that finally crushed
                    their faith.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Mills said: "They may have had some scepticism based on
                    logical reasoning – like how can Santa Claus really get
                    around the world in one night? – but what pushes them over
                    the edge is a classmate at school saying he's not real."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Roughly a third of children and half of adults reported some
                    negative emotions upon falling for the rumour that Santa
                    doesn't exist. Although these feelings were usually mild and
                    short-lived, about 10% of adults reported longer-lasting
                    sadness or reduced trust in their parents as a result.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Such feelings tended to be associated with learning abruptly
                    or being told directly that Santa isn't real, making this
                    discovery at an older age, and having parents who had
                    strongly supported the existence of Santa, eg by making
                    videos of him in their living room or leaving trails of
                    glitter on the floor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, there were also many children who reported feeling
                    happy or relieved when they gave up their faith. "It was
                    like they'd solved some sort of riddle," Mills said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although Santa clearly frowns on such behaviour, he will be
                    relieved to hear that, regardless of their experience, the
                    vast majority of sceptical adults and children said that
                    they would continue the Santa tradition with their own
                    children, or were already doing so.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As for how Santa deniers should handle Santa-related
                    questions when they crop up, Mills suggested listening
                    closely to what the child is asking, before answering. If
                    they want to know how Santa fits down narrow chimneys, or
                    gets into houses that don't have one, they may not be ready
                    to give up the idea of Santa. Consider asking the child what
                    they think, talking about what "some people" believe, or
                    simply say "that's an interesting question".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If asked directly whether Santa is real, caregivers could
                    also use a deflecting question, such as "what do you think?"
                    and see how the child discusses it themselves. "There can
                    sometimes be some tension, because they want to keep
                    believing in the magic, but they also want to know the
                    truth," said Mills. Turning it back on the child can help
                    caregivers assess their needs at that point in time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When Mills was asked this question by her own children, she
                    initially deflected, but when they said, "I want to know the
                    truth" – Mills told them. "They were very proud of
                    themselves and they celebrated."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some children may also be more sensitive about being lied to
                    than others, she added. One of the adults she interviewed
                    said they had felt very betrayed by their parents because
                    they had taught them not to lie, but had been doing it
                    themselves. Mills said: "In such cases, parents can soften
                    the blow by acknowledging their child's feelings and talking
                    about why they have included Santa in their holiday
                    traditions."

                    Zhang and his colleagues did not disclose the efficiency of
                    their engine in their research paper. However, based on
                    previous scientific estimates, the explosion of combustible
                    gases can convert nearly 80% of chemical energy into kinetic
                    energy. This is a significant improvement compared to
                    conventional turbofan engines, which typically achieve
                    20-30% efficiencies and rely on slow and gentle combustion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Zhang's team claims that their design, which integrates
                    rotational and straight-line detonation across a wide speed
                    range, is a "world first" testament to Chinese ingenuity.
                    "This solution has obvious advantages and is expected to
                    improve the optimal thermodynamic cycle efficiency in nearly
                    all speed ranges, bringing a revolutionary change in
                    aerospace propulsion," the researchers said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Zhang's team, the transition to the new
                    detonation engine was challenging due to the two operating
                    modes. As the speed approached Mach 7, the rotating
                    detonation mode became unsustainable. Therefore, the oblique
                    detonation mode had to be ignited quickly. According to the
                    authors, there are some potential solutions to the problem.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One is to decrease the incoming air speed from Mach 7 to
                    Mach 4 or even lower. This will allow the fuel to heat up
                    adequately for auto-ignition. Another solution is to make
                    slight adjustments to the engine's internal structure, such
                    as modifying the diameter of the circular platform and the
                    angle of the shock wave tilt. These modifications could have
                    an impact on the engine's overall performance.

                      >Firefly Green Fuels</a
                    >, a UK-based company, has developed a new form of jet fuel
                    that is entirely fossil-free and made from human waste. The
                    company worked with experts at Cranfield University to
                    confirm that the fuel they developed had a 90 percent lower
                    carbon footprint than what is used in aviation today,
                    according to the BBC. Tests by independent regulators
                    validated that what Firefly Green Fuels has developed is
                    nearly identical to standard A1 jet fuel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2021, the company received a £2 million grant from the
                    Department of Transport to continue developing its
                    sustainable aviation fuel. Although it's not yet available
                    commercially, the company says it is on track to bringing
                    its fuel to the global market and it will have its first
                    commercial plant operating within 5 years. The company has
                    already inked a partnership with the budget airline Wizz Air
                    — the name of the company and the source of its potential
                    combustibles could scarcely be a more perfect pairing — to
                    supply it with fuel starting in 2028.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It currently sources its waste from water companies in the
                    UK and takes the refined sewage through a process called
                    hydrothermal liquefaction, which converts the liquid waste
                    into a sludge or crude oil. Solid by-products can also be
                    made into crop fertilizer. The company claims that the
                    carbon intensity of the whole process — which measures how
                    much carbon is needed to produce energy — is 7.97 grams of
                    carbon dioxide per megajoule (gCO²e/MJ). Comparatively, the
                    ICCT says carbon intensity recorded for jet fuel ranges from
                    85 to 95 gCO²e/MJ.

                  <p>
                    [...] The achievement of carbon neutrality in our airspaces
                    has been a longtime goal for regulators and leaders in
                    Europe and the US. While EVs have made headway in the car
                    industry, it might be a while before we see battery powered
                    commercial jets. So in the meantime, solutions for creating
                    more environmentally-friendly jet fuel are welcome.

                    Researchers have developed a new, lightweight foam made from
                    carbon nanotubes that, when used as a helmet liner, absorbed
                    the kinetic energy caused by an impact almost 30 times
                    better than liners currently used in US military helmets.
                    The foam could prevent or significantly reduce the
                    likelihood of concussion in military personnel and
                    sportspeople.

                    (TBI) is one of the major causes of permanent disability and
                    death. Injury statistics show that the majority of TBIs, of
                    which concussion is a subtype, are associated with oblique
                    impacts, which subject the brain to a combination of linear
                    and rotational kinetic energy forces and cause shearing of
                    the delicate brain tissue.

                    into vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) foams –
                    carefully arranged layers of carbon cylinders one atom thick
                    – and their exceptional shock-absorbing capabilities.
                    Current helmets attempt to reduce rotational motion by
                    allowing a sliding motion between the wearer's head and the
                    helmet during impact. However, the researchers say this
                    movement doesn't dissipate energy in shear and can jam when
                    severely compressed following a blow. Instead, their novel
                    foam doesn't rely on sliding layers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    VACNT foam sidesteps this shortcoming via its unique
                    deformation mechanism. Under compression, the VACNTs undergo
                    collective sequentially progressive buckling, from increased
                    compliance at low shear strain levels to a stiffening
                    response at high strain levels. The formed compression
                    buckles unfold completely, enabling the VACNT foam to
                    accommodate large shear strains before returning to a near
                    initial state when the load is removed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers found that at 25% precompression, the foam
                    exhibited almost 30 times higher energy dissipation in shear
                    – up to 50% shear strain – than polyurethane-based
                    elastomeric foams of similar density.

                    in helmets, VACNT foam could be used in electronic packaging

                From the Staff of SoylentNews.Org, may we wish every member of
                our community a very Happy and Prosperous New Year.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a little over 1 month's time we will have been active as a
                site for 10 years. Hopefully by then we will also have created
                the new site and will be looking at another 10 years or more
                ahead of us. That still requires some more work from everyone as
                it is the community who will be deciding how the site is run,
                what the new policies will be, what subjects are discussed and
                how we grow our community in the future. The entire Board will
                consist of volunteers elected from the community by the
                community.
              </p>
              <p>
                But for now let us all look forward to the new year and
                celebrate together!

                    Both the Hadza and Yao people have their own unique
                    languages, and sounds from them may have been incorporated
                    into their calls. But there is more to it than that. The
                    Hadza often hunt animals when hunting for honey. Therefore,
                    the Hadza don't want their calls to be recognized as human,
                    or else the prey they are after might sense a threat and
                    flee. This may be why they use whistles to communicate with
                    honeyguides—by sounding like birds, they can both attract
                    the honeyguides and stalk prey without being detected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In contrast, the Yao do not hunt mammals, relying mostly on
                    agriculture and fishing for food. This, along with the fact
                    that they try to avoid potentially dangerous creatures such
                    as lions, rhinos, and elephants, and can explain why they
                    use recognizably human vocalizations to call honeyguides.
                    Human voices may scare these animals away, so Yao honey
                    hunters can safely seek honey with their honeyguide
                    partners. These findings show that cultural diversity has
                    had a significant influence on calls to honeyguides.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While animals might not literally speak our language, the
                    honeyguide is just one of many species that has its own way
                    of communicating with us. They can even learn our cultural
                    traditions.

                    the startup world are on display here (including a
                    preference for lying and monkeying with data over actually
                    doing good work). They're also, in turn, mere appendages of
                    a deeper and more profound decadence. In 2023, discovery,

                    frontier. What matters isn't whether any of this has been
                    done before, and more authentically, and well enough to be
                    built upon—what matters is that this particular rich

                    [...] "They aren't really Red Hat any longer, they're IBM,"
                    Perens writes in the note he shared with
                    <em>The Register</em>. "And of course they stopped
                    distributing CentOS, and for a long time they've done
                    something that I feel violates the GPL, and

                      href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/03/27/grsecurity_bruce_perens_gpl_settlement/"
                      >my defamation case</a
                    >
                    was about another company doing the exact same thing: They
                    tell you that if you are a RHEL customer, you can't disclose
                    the GPL source for security patches that RHEL makes, because
                    they won't allow you to be a customer any longer. IBM
                    employees assert that they are still feeding patches to the
                    upstream open source project, but of course they aren't
                    required to do so.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This has gone on for a long time, and only the fact that
                    Red Hat made a public distribution of CentOS (essentially an
                    unbranded version of RHEL) made it tolerable. Now IBM isn't
                    doing that any longer. So I feel that IBM has gotten
                    everything it wants from the open source developer community
                    now, and we've received something of a middle finger from
                    them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Obviously CentOS was important to companies as well, and
                    they are running for the wings in adopting Rocky Linux. I
                    could wish they went to a Debian derivative, but OK. But we
                    have a number of straws on the Open Source camel's back.
                    Will one break it?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another straw burdening the Open Source camel, Perens
                    writes, "is that Open Source has completely failed to serve
                    the common person. For the most part, if they use us at all
                    they do so through a proprietary software company's systems,
                    like Apple iOS or Google Android, both of which use Open
                    Source for infrastructure but the apps are mostly
                    proprietary. The common person doesn't know about Open
                    Source, they don't know about the freedoms we promote which
                    are increasingly in their interest. Indeed, Open Source is
                    used today to surveil and even oppress them."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Free Software, Perens explains, is now 50 years old and the
                    first announcement of Open Source occurred 30 years ago.
                    "Isn't it time for us to take a look at what we've been
                    doing, and see if we can do better? Well, yes, but we need
                    to preserve Open Source at the same time. Open Source will
                    continue to exist and provide the same rules and paradigm,
                    and the thing that comes after Open Source should be called
                    something else and should never try to pass itself off as
                    Open Source. So far, I call it Post-Open."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Post-Open, as he describes it, is a bit more involved than
                    Open Source. It would define the corporate relationship with
                    developers to ensure companies paid a fair amount for the
                    benefits they receive. It would remain free for individuals
                    and non-profit, and would entail just one license.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He imagines a simple yearly compliance process that gets
                    companies all the rights they need to use Post-Open
                    software. And they'd fund developers who would be encouraged
                    to write software that's usable by the common person, as
                    opposed to technical experts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pointing to popular applications from Apple, Google, and
                    Microsoft, Perens says: "A lot of the software is oriented
                    toward the customer being the product – they're certainly
                    surveilled a great deal, and in some cases are actually
                    abused. So it's a good time for open source to actually do
                    stuff for normal people."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The reason that doesn't often happen today, says Perens, is
                    that open source developers tend to write code for
                    themselves and those who are similarly adept with
                    technology. The way to avoid that, he argues, is to pay
                    developers, so they have support to take the time to make
                    user-friendly applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Companies, he suggests, would foot the bill, which could be
                    apportioned to contributing developers using the sort of
                    software that instruments GitHub and shows who contributes
                    what to which products. Merico, he says, is a company that
                    provides such software.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Perens acknowledges that a lot of stumbling blocks need to
                    be overcome, like finding an acceptable entity to handle the
                    measurements and distribution of funds. What's more, the
                    financial arrangements have to appeal to enough developers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "And all of this has to be transparent and adjustable enough
                    that it doesn't fork 100 different ways," he muses. "So, you
                    know, that's one of my big questions. Can this really
                    happen?"

                    and I don't think that is going to be the long-term

                    [...] The Clueless's creations, among other virtual
                    influencers, have also been criticized for being overly
                    sexualised, with Aitana regularly appearing in underwear.
                    The agency said sexualisation is "prevalent with real models
                    and influencers" and that its creations "merely mirror these
                    established practices without deviating from the current
                    norms in the industry."

                  <p>
                    Mercer, the human influencer, argued: "It feels like women
                    in recent years have been able to take back some agency,
                    through OnlyFans, through social media, they have been able
                    to take control of their bodies and say 'for so long men
                    have made money off me, I am going to make money for
                    myself'."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But she said AI-generated creations, often made by men, were
                    once again profiting from female sexuality. "That is the
                    reason behind growing these accounts. It is to make money."
