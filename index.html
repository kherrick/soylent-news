                    A tokamak in France set a new record in fusion plasma by
                    encasing its reaction in tungsten, a heat-resistant metal
                    that allows physicists to sustain hot plasmas for longer,
                    and at higher energies and densities than carbon tokamaks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The recent achievement was made in WEST (tungsten (W)
                    Environment in Steady-state Tokamak), a tokamak operated by
                    the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission
                    (CEA). WEST was injected with 1.15 gigajoules of power and
                    sustained a plasma of about 50 million degrees Celsius for
                    six minutes. It achieved this record after scientists
                    encased the tokamak's interior in tungsten, a metal with an
                    extraordinarily high melting point. Researchers from
                    Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory used an X-ray detector
                    inside the tokamak to measure aspects of the plasma and the
                    conditions that made it possible."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Earlier this year, the Korea Institute of Fusion
                    Energy installed a tungsten diverter in its KSTAR tokamak,
                    replacing the device's carbon diverter. Tungsten has a
                    higher melting point than carbon, and according to Korea's
                    National Research Council of Science and Technology, the new
                    diverter improves the reactor's heat flux limit two-fold.
                    KSTAR's new diverter enabled the institute's team to sustain
                    high-ion temperatures exceeding 100 million degrees Celsius
                    for longer.

                    A maximum severity vulnerability that allows hackers to
                    hijack GitLab accounts with no user interaction required is
                    now under active exploitation, federal government officials
                    warned as data showed that thousands of users had yet to
                    install a patch released in January.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A change GitLab implemented in May 2023 made it possible for
                    users to initiate password changes through links sent to
                    secondary email addresses. The move was designed to permit
                    resets when users didn't have access to the email address
                    used to establish the account. In January, GitLab
                    <a
                      href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/01/11/critical-security-release-gitlab-16-7-2-released/"
                      >disclosed</a
                    >
                    that the feature allowed attackers to send reset emails to
                    accounts they controlled and from there click on the
                    embedded link and take over the account.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While exploits require no user interaction, hijackings work
                    only against accounts that aren't configured to use
                    multifactor authentication. Even with MFA, accounts remained
                    vulnerable to password resets, but the attackers ultimately
                    are unable to access the account, allowing the rightful
                    owner to change the reset password. The vulnerability,
                    tracked as CVE-2023-7028, carries a severity rating of 10
                    out of 10.

                    it is aware of "evidence of active exploitation" and added
                    the vulnerability to its list of known exploited
                    vulnerabilities. CISA provided no details about the
                    in-the-wild attacks. A GitLab representative declined to
                    provide specifics about the active exploitation of the

                    The vulnerability, classified as an improper access control
                    flaw, could pose a grave threat. GitLab software typically
                    has access to multiple development environments belonging to
                    users. With the ability to access them and surreptitiously
                    introduce changes, attackers could sabotage projects or
                    plant backdoors that could infect anyone using software
                    built in the compromised environment. An example of a
                    similar supply chain attack is the one that hit

                    The 8088 processor communicates over the bus with memory and
                    I/O devices through a highly-structured sequence of steps
                    called "T-states." A typical 8088 bus cycle consists of four
                    T-states, with one T-state per clock cycle. Although a
                    four-step bus cycle may sound straightforward, its
                    implementation uses a complicated state machine making it
                    one of the most difficult parts of the 8088 to explain.
                    First, the 8088 has many special cases that complicate the
                    bus cycle. Moreover, the bus cycle is really six steps, with
                    two undocumented "extra" steps to make bus operations more
                    efficient. Finally, the complexity of the bus cycle is
                    largely arbitrary, a consequence of Intel's attempts to make
                    the 8088's bus backward-compatible with the earlier 8080 and
                    8085 processors. However, investigating the bus cycle
                    circuitry in detail provides insight into the timing of the
                    processor's instructions. In addition, this circuitry
                    illustrates the tradeoffs and implementation decisions that
                    are necessary in a production processor. In this blog post,
                    I look in detail at the circuitry that implements this state
                    machine.

                    [...] On top of that, there's the garbage-in, garbage-out
                    problem. AI trained on narratives provided by officers may
                    take it upon themselves to "correct" narratives that seem to
                    indicate an officer may have done something wrong. It's also
                    going to lend itself to biased policing by tech-washing BS
                    stops by racist cops, portraying these as essential
                    contributions to public safety.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of course, plenty of officers do these sorts of things
                    already, so there's a possibility it won't make anything
                    <em>worse</em>. But if the process Axon is pitching makes
                    things <em>faster</em>, there's no reason to believe what's
                    already wrong with American policing won't get worse in
                    future. And, as the tech improves (so to speak), the
                    exacerbation of existing problems and the problems
                    introduced by the addition of AI will steadily accelerate.

                    That's not to say there's no utility in processes that
                    reduce the amount of time spent on paperwork. But it seems
                    splitting off a clerical division might be a better solution
                    — a part of the police force that handles the paperwork and
                    vets camera footage, but is performed by people who are not
                    the same ones who captured the recordings and participated
                    in the traffic stop, investigation, or dispatch call
                    response.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And I will say this for Axon: at least its CEO recognizes
                    the problems this could introduce and suggests agencies
                    limit automated report creation to things like misdemeanors
                    and never in cases where deadly force is deployed. But, like
                    any product, it will be the end users who decide how it's
                    used. And so far, the expected end users are more than
                    willing to streamline things they view as inessential, but
                    are far less interested in curtailing abuse by those using
                    these systems. Waiting to see how things play out just isn't
                    an acceptable option — not when there are actual lives and
                    liberties on the line.

                    A new study reveals that cooperation by bumblebees isn't
                    simply a result of accumulated individual efforts. Rather,
                    these miniature-brained creatures are not just hard-working
                    pollinators, but also show signs of being master
                    collaborators.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study, conducted at the University of Oulu in Finland
                    and published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B,
                    demonstrates the role of teamwork for bumblebees in novel
                    cooperative challenges.

                  <p>
                    It has previously been thought that understanding the role
                    of a partner in a cooperative task is a complex phenomenon
                    that is mainly characteristic of big-brained mammals such as
                    humans and chimpanzees. But new research shows that even
                    insects can learn and adapt to cooperative tasks.
                    Understanding how collaboration has become so important for
                    humans requires comparisons with other species.

                    insects, and the ability to work together towards a common
                    goal is present even in the miniature brain of bumblebees,"
                    says lead researcher, Associate Professor, Dr. Olli Loukola.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the study, pairs of bumblebees were trained in two
                    different cooperative tasks. Bees learned to simultaneously
                    push a Lego block in the middle of an arena, or to
                    simultaneously push a door at the end of a transparent
                    double tunnel to gain access to rewarding nectar.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bumblebees' behaviors suggest their efforts towards solving
                    the cooperative tasks were influenced by the presence,
                    absence, and movement direction of their partner. When their
                    partner was delayed, bees tended to take longer than
                    controls to initiate pushing and were more likely to push
                    only when their partner pushed with them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In short, bees trained on cooperative tasks seemed to wait
                    for their partner. The bumblebees in the control group,
                    which had been trained alone, did not show similar behavior.

                    On May 3, China launched Chang’e 6, its latest mission to
                    the Moon. Similar to its predecessor, it is a sample
                    retrieval mission, expected to collect up to 2 kilograms
                    (4.4 pounds) of lunar material from the far side of the
                    Moon, the portion that is always facing away from Earth. The
                    whole mission is expected to last 53 days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    China has already broken records on the far side by becoming

                    and only nation to soft-land there with Chang’e 4 in 2019.
                    That mission landed in the Von Kármán crater, which is 180
                    kilometers (110 miles) across and sits within the South
                    Pole-Aitken Basin. Chang’e 6 is targeting another area of
                    the basin: the Apollo crater, which is three times as wide
                    as the Von Kármán.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The interest in this area lies in the distant past of the
                    Moon. Underneath this region, there is
                    <a

                    >, potentially part of the colossal object that slammed into
                    the Moon and created the basin 4 billion years ago. The
                    jackpot would be to find portions of the lunar mantle and
                    bring them back to Earth.

                  <p>

                    is equipped with a scoop to collect soil and rocks from the
                    surface, as well as a drill to collect subsurface samples.
                    An ascent vehicle will launch the samples into orbit, where
                    it will rendezvous with an orbiter and come back to Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That is not the only focus of the mission, however. The
                    lander and orbiter include scientific payloads from other
                    countries too, which aim to understand dust and outgassing
                    on the Moon, studying lunar magnetism, among other goals.

                    [...] In the US, China’s plans are being seen with increased
                    anxiety. On April 17, the House Appropriations Subcommittee
                    on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies held a
                    hearing about the NASA Budget for 2025. Both the chair,
                    representative Harold Rogers (R-KY), and NASA Administrator
                    Bill Nelson made reference to a new space race.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The National Aeronautics and Space Administration was
                    founded in 1958 in response to the so-called Space Race with
                    the Soviet Union to land the first man on the Moon. Today we
                    find ourselves in yet another space race, this time with
                    China,” Rogers stated during the
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NISFxcWeZNA"
                      >hearing</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “We are in a race,” Nelson replied to a question from Rogers
                    on Chinese plans. “The latest date they've said they're
                    going to land [on the moon] is 2030 but that keeps moving
                    up.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Nelson also said that he believes that the Chinese
                    civilian space program is actually a military program. The
                    comments have been seen as venting a frustration about the
                    comparatively limited budget NASA operates. Others have
                    considered Nelson’s comments as coming across as
                    hypocritical given NASA’s many links to the
                    military-industrial complex and the

              <p>
                Audioguy was one of the original team who created the existing
                SoylentNews site. He has stayed with us since that time and has
                served the community as a sys-admin for over 10 years. It is no
                exaggeration to say that over the last year or two he has played
                an almost single-handed role in keeping this site working.
              </p>
              <p>
                Audioguy has suffered a series of significant personal and
                medical events over the last 6 months or so. He is now about to
                commence ophthalmic surgery tomorrow (Wednesday) and is facing
                other potentially life changing medical issues in the near
                future. He has, quite understandably and reluctantly, been
                forced to stand down from his role which was effective from late
                last week. Unfortunately that has meant that we have lost the
                ability to correct the current certificates problem. Access to
                the Linode servers is still controlled by the existing Board and
                we have experienced additional problems accessing one of our
                servers by the usual methods. This appears to be common to many
                staff and has further exacerbated the current problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have written an email to NCommander requesting his assistance
                in updating the certificates so that the site becomes fully
                operational again. Your patience is appreciated. What might
                appear to many in the community to be a relatively minor issue
                is, behind the scenes, a major blow to the existing team. We
                have other sys-admins who are ready to pick up the challenge but
                they do not yet have the necessary access, nor are they yet
                experienced in managing the beast that that is Slashd.
              </p>
              <p>
                Returning to audioguy, I am sure that the entire community would
                wish to join me in thanking him for a decade of support to the
                site, and to wish him well for the upcoming surgery. He remains
                one of this community and evidence of his past contributions can
                be found in numerous bits of code and associated documentation.
                He has also, for example, been the manager of the technical wiki
                which has been vital to the support team for all of that period.
                We are indebted to him.
              </p>
              <p>
                Good luck for the future, audioguy. Take it easy. Best wishes to
                you and your family.

                    To create the counterfeits, the Chinese suppliers often took
                    older, lower-model products, some of which were previously
                    discarded, and modified them to appear new, while loading
                    pirated Cisco software on the hardware.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The counterfeits looked real enough to fool government
                    buyers. Federal investigators say that some of the fake
                    equipment was used in classified information systems. "The
                    devices were also identified in combat and non-combat
                    operations of the US Navy, US Air Force, and US Army, such
                    as platforms supporting the F-15, F-18, and F-22 fighter
                    jets, AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, P-8 maritime patrol
                    aircraft, and B-52 Stratofortress bomber aircraft," the DOJ
                    adds.

                  <p>
                    US authorities and Cisco began cracking down on Askoy as
                    early as 2014 by seizing the counterfeit shipments and
                    ordering him to stop. But he was still able to avoid
                    scrutiny by conspiring with his Chinese suppliers to traffic
                    the goods into the US.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Following his arrest in 2022, Askoy pleaded guilty to
                    charges related to the fraud scheme a year later. As part of
                    his plea agreement, Aksoy will pay Cisco and his other
                    victims $100 million in restitution for committing the
                    fraud.

                    <strong>really hoped</strong> they could extend that winning
                    streak even further and bar states from standing up to them

                    One of the things that <em>absolutely terrifies</em> telecom
                    monopoly lobbyists is the idea of rate regulation, or that
                    government would ever stop them from ripping off captive
                    customers stuck in uncompetitive markets. It’s never been a
                    serious threat on the federal level due to regulatory
                    capture and lobbying, even though it’s thrown around
                    <strong>a lot</strong> by monopoly apologists as a
                    terrifying bogeyman akin to leprosy.

                    As humans prepare to return to the moon after an absence of
                    more than half a century, researchers have hit on a radical
                    approach to keeping astronauts fit as they potter around the
                    ball of rock.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To prevent lunar explorers from becoming weak and feeble in
                    the low gravity environment, scientists suggest astronauts
                    go for a run. But, this being space, it's not just any kind
                    of run – researchers have advised astronauts run several
                    times a day around a "lunar Wall of Death".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using a rented Wall of Death – a giant wooden cylinder used
                    by motorcycle stunt performers in their gravity-defying
                    fairground act – a 36m-high telescopic crane, and some
                    bungee cords, researchers showed it was possible for a human
                    to run fast enough in lunar gravity not only to remain on
                    the wall, but to generate sufficient lateral force to combat
                    bone and muscle wasting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I'm amazed that nobody had the idea before," said Alberto
                    Minetti, professor of physiology at the University of Milan.
                    "This could be a convenient way to train on the moon." And
                    easier than building a spinning moon base that generates the
                    force, like the giant wheel of Space Station One in 2001: A
                    Space Odyssey.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The hostile lunar environment presents several
                    challenges, from ensuring astronauts have air, food and
                    water to being well protected against space radiation. But
                    without normal gravity to work against, astronauts lose bone
                    and muscle mass, along with the fine nervous system control
                    needed for coordinated movements, making measures to combat
                    "deconditioning" a priority.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To test the idea, two researchers ran around a
                    10m-wide Wall of Death while attached to a bungee cord
                    suspended from the crane. The set-up emulated lunar gravity
                    by taking five-sixths off their body weight. Combined with
                    treadmill data, the scientists conclude that running for a
                    couple of minutes at the start and end of each day, should
                    generate enough lateral force, or "artificial gravity" to
                    keep bones and muscles strong and maintain good nervous
                    system control.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rather than transporting an actual Wall of Death to the
                    moon, astronauts could be housed in circular habitats,
                    allowing them to run around the walls of their off-world
                    homes, the team write in

                    be artificially incubated, so it is possible to manipulate

                    The research team, led by Dr. Alizée Meillère and Dr. Mylene
                    Mariette from the School of Life and Environmental Sciences
                    at Deakin University (Australia) and Doñana Biological
                    Station (Spain), took advantage of this by playing sounds to
                    the eggs of an Australian native bird, the zebra finch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They discovered that—under otherwise optimal incubation
                    conditions—eggs are less likely to hatch when exposed to
                    traffic noise for five days before hatching, than when
                    exposed to the species native song.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Both traffic noise and song were played at the same
                    moderate amplitude—65 decibels, which is similar to a
                    conversation level—but something about the acoustic
                    characteristics of the noise caused embryonic death," said
                    Dr. Mariette.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Nestlings exposed to noise rather than song were
                    slower to grow and showed more severe signs of cellular
                    damage," said Dr. Mariette. "These negative effects were the
                    result of both previous noise exposure before hatching and
                    current exposure during the nestling stage."

                    A team of physicists from several institutions across the
                    U.S. working with a colleague from China, at the DIII-D
                    National Fusion Facility, in San Diego, California, has
                    devised a way to overcome two key hurdles standing in the
                    way of using fusion as a general power source.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In their
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07313-3"
                      >paper</a
                    >
                    published in the journal <i>Nature</i>, the group describes
                    how they devised a way to raise the density of the plasma in
                    their reactor while also keeping it stable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] It was just in the past couple of years that
                    researchers were able to show that a fusion reaction could
                    be made to sustain itself, and that more power could be
                    produced than was input into such a system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The next two hurdles to overcome are increasing the density
                    of the plasma in the reactor and then containing it for
                    extended periods of time—long enough for it to be useful for
                    producing electricity. In this new study, the research team
                    has devised a way to do both in a tokamak chamber.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To contain the plasma as its density was increased, the team
                    used additional magnets and bursts of deuterium where
                    needed. They also allowed for higher densities at the core
                    than near the edges, helping to ensure the plasma could not
                    escape. They held it in that state for 2.2 seconds, long
                    enough to prove that it could be done.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The research team acknowledges that their experiment
                    was done in a very small reactor—one with a diameter of just
                    1.6 meters. For such an achievement to be considered fully
                    successful, it will have to be done in a much larger
                    reactor, such as the one currently under construction in
                    France, which will have a diameter of 6.2 meters.

                at a ministerial meeting that they will shut down coal-fired
                power plants by 2030-2035, or on a timeline consistent with the
                1.5 C degree temperature limit. In addition, the G7 countries
                announced they will rapidly scale-up battery storage sixfold by
                2030 to support electricity grids powered by renewable energy
                sources.

                The latest G7 statement is not entirely surprising if you've
                been following coal consumption in the countries mentioned. In
                2003, the G7 still were the proud owners of a 44% share in
                global coal-fired electricity. By 2013, that share had lowered
                to 26.5% -- currently it is down to 11%. But still.

              <p>
                For example, Japan imported just over 110 million metric tons of
                thermal coal last year, compared to around 330 million tons
                imported by China and 170 million tons by India. Their current
                suppliers are Australia, Indonesia, Russia and Canada. Some
                fast-growing economies elsewhere, including India, the
                Philippines and Vietnam, may snap up some of the reduced volumes
                bought by G7 nations over the near term. But in the longer run
                those and other nations plan to sharply increase clean power
                generation and cut back on fossil fuel use.

                    Ukraine unveils AI-generated foreign ministry spokesperson
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Victoria Shi is modelled on Rosalie Nombre, a singer and
                    former contestant on Ukraine's version of the reality show
                    The Bachelor
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ukraine on Wednesday presented an AI-generated spokesperson
                    called Victoria who will make official statements on behalf
                    of its foreign ministry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ministry said it would "for the first time in history"
                    use a digital spokesperson to read its statements, which
                    will still be written by humans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dressed in a dark suit, the spokesperson introduced herself
                    as Victoria Shi, a "digital person", in a presentation
                    posted on social media. The figure gesticulates with her
                    hands and moves her head as she speaks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The foreign ministry's press service said that the
                    statements given by Shi would not be generated by AI but
                    "written and verified by real people".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's only the visual part that the AI helps us to
                    generate," Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister,
                    said, adding that the new spokesperson was a "technological
                    leap that no diplomatic service in the world has yet made".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The main reason for creating her was "saving time and
                    resources" for diplomats, he said. Shi's creators are a team
                    called the Game Changers who have also made virtual-reality
                    content related to the war in Ukraine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The spokesperson's name is based on the word "victory" and
                    the Ukrainian phrase for artificial intelligence:
                    <em>shtuchniy intelekt</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shi's appearance and voice are modelled on a real person:
                    Rosalie Nombre, a singer and former contestant on Ukraine's
                    version of the reality show The Bachelor. Nombre was born in
                    the now Russian-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern
                    Ukraine. She has 54,000 followers on her Instagram account,
                    which she uses to discuss stereotypes about mixed-race
                    Ukrainians and those who grew up as Russian speakers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ministry said that Nombre took part free of charge. It
                    stressed that Shi and Nombre "are two different people" and
                    that only the AI figure will give official statements.

                    We've noted repeatedly that while "AI" (language learning

                    It's been a particular problem in healthcare, where broken
                    "AI" is being layered on top of already broken systems. Like
                    in insurance, where error-prone automation, programmed from
                    the ground up to prioritize money over health, is

                    recording, which was circulated widely on social media, made

                    In the Middle Ages, it was still thought best to isolate
                    those with leprosy from the rest of the population, and one
                    way of doing that was to build special "hospitals" called

                    in the South of England, which also had strong connections
                    to the fur trade. This is where the team sourced the

                  <p>
                    Sixty years ago, on May 1, 1964, at
                    <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/basicfifty/basic.html"
                      >4 am in the morning</a
                    >, a quiet revolution in computing began at Dartmouth
                    College. That's when mathematicians John G. Kemeny and
                    Thomas E. Kurtz successfully ran the first program written
                    in their newly developed BASIC (Beginner's All-Purpose
                    Symbolic Instruction Code) programming language on the
                    college's General Electric GE-225 mainframe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Little did they know that their creation would go on to
                    democratize computing and inspire generations of programmers
                    over the next six decades.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Prior to BASIC, programming languages like
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a>,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL">Algol</a>, and
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>
                    proved complex and were primarily used by professionals.
                    Kemeny and Kurtz saw a need for amateurs who were not
                    dedicated computer engineers to be able to use computers as
                    well. Their journey to create a more user-friendly language
                    began in 1956 with Dartmouth Simplified Code (<a
                      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARSIMCO"
                      >DARIMSCO</a
                    >), followed by the Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming
                    Experiment (<a
                      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_Oversimplified_Programming_Experiment"
                      >DOPE</a
                    >). While DOPE proved too simple to be of much use, the
                    lessons learned from these projects informed the development
                    of BASIC, which started in 1963.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The impact of BASIC extended far beyond Dartmouth's
                    campus. As part of the deal to buy the GE computer, the
                    undergraduates built the operating system in BASIC for
                    General Electric's version of time-sharing. This allowed
                    colleges, high schools, and individuals across the country
                    to dial into mainframe computers and write programs using
                    BASIC.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1975, Paul Allen and Bill Gates adapted the language for
                    personal computers like the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800"
                      >Altair 8800</a
                    >, expanding its reach to a new audience of small computer
                    owners and founding Microsoft in the process. In 1976, Steve
                    Wozniak

                    >
                    for the Apple I using self-taught methods and minimal
                    resources. This became
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_BASIC"
                      >Integer BASIC</a
                    >
                    for the Apple II a year later, and BASIC (as

                      >Applesoft BASIC</a
                    >) remained a key part of the Apple II throughout the
                    platform's lifespan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Today, BASIC remains popular in hobbyist
                    retrocomputing circles, but few use it as a practical
                    language. And yet it never truly died out—instead, it
                    continued to evolve.

                      >KB5036893</a
                    >, which was initially released on April 9, 2024. The update
                    makes "miscellaneous security improvements to internal OS
                    functionality," among a few other minor changes. The company
                    hasn't provided specific information on what's been broken
                    or what needs fixing, noting only that PCs "might face VPN
                    connection failures" after installing the update.

                    The April 2024 Windows security patch appears to be the
                    culprit for broken Virtual Private Network functionality.
                    The bug prevents users from connecting to a VPN to conceal
                    their home Wi-Fi network's IP address when browsing the web
                    or accessing content from abroad.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Microsoft has acknowledged the issue, with the KB5036893
                    that dropped almost a month ago, which it says affects all
                    current versions of Windows 11, Windows 10 and Windows
                    Server. It promises a fix is incoming.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On a support page (via The Verge), the company says: "VPN
                    connections might fail after installing the April 2024
                    security update.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Windows devices might face VPN connection failures after
                    installing the April 2024 security update (KB5036893) or the
                    April 2024 non-security preview update. We are working on a
                    resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming
                    release."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Windows users wait for the resolution, the only known
                    workaround is to roll back the operating system update, and
                    uninstall the update.

                    [....] This is a fairly modernized and refurbished
                    late-1980s single-user GUI-based OS, and that implies some
                    limitations. It was first released the same year as OS/2
                    1.0, long before Apple System 7 or Windows 3.0. In fact,
                    it'll remind you of Windows 3 on MS-DOS: it's a
                    single-tasking text-mode OS, with networking, on top of
                    which is a graphical desktop that does cooperative
                    multitasking. RISC OS gives applications access to much of
                    the memory map, and so if a program accidentally scribbles
                    over the wrong parts of that address space, the whole
                    computer can freeze up – which in testing our Pi 400 did
                    several times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But saying that, it's an admirably complete OS, in this
                    vulture's opinion, with quite a rich portfolio of
                    applications. RISC OS 5.30 comes with a selection of
                    productivity apps, plus development tools, including a
                    choice of editors, Python, Lua, and a C compiler – and of
                    course with a 32-bit version of BBC BASIC V, a fully
                    structured interpreter which also supports inline Arm
                    assembly language.

                    [...] Here, they concluded that flow-mediated interactions
                    between neighbors are, in effect, spring-like forces that
                    hold each member in place—just as if the cars of a train
                    were connected by springs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, these "springs" act in only one direction—a lead
                    bird can exert force on its follower, but not vice versa—and
                    this non-reciprocal interaction means that later members
                    tend to resonate or oscillate wildly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The oscillations look like waves that jiggle the members
                    forwards and backwards and which travel down the group and
                    increase in intensity, causing later members to crash
                    together," explains Joel Newbolt, who was an NYU graduate
                    student in physics at the time of research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team named these new types of waves "flonons," which is
                    based on the similar concept of phonons that refer to
                    vibrational waves in systems of masses linked by springs and
                    which are used to model the motions of atoms or molecules in
                    crystals or other materials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Our findings therefore raise some interesting connections
                    to material physics in which birds in an orderly flock are
                    analogous to atoms in a regular crystal," Newbolt adds.

                    Lewis and Tolkien shared a love of Norse mythology, and
                    Lewis read the first early drafts of what would become
                    Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien later said he
                    owed his friend "an unpayable debt" for convincing him the
                    "stuff" could be more than merely a "private hobby."
                    Tolkien, in turn, was the one who convinced Lewis—an atheist
                    in his youth—to convert to Christianity.

                  <p>
                    [...] "Since Þrýþ was wicked and her mood was fierce,
                    according to Tolkien's interpretation and translation that
                    Lewis seems to agree with, the negative phrase in the title
                    of the poem can only be read as a compliment to Ida Gordon,"
                    Cossio wrote. Taken together with Lewis's adherence to the
                    alliterative meter of Beowulf, Cossio concludes that the
                    newly discovered poem was clearly written "from one
                    medievalist to another."

                    About a month ago, a developer notified The Register (<i
                      >El Reg</i
                    >, for the <i>conoscenti</i>) that part of the documentation
                    of an AI powered infrastructure-as-code tool was turning up
                    on the Internet. Problem: the documentation itself was
                    written by an LLM and, as one has come to expect, it
                    <i>sometimes</i> hallucinated. In layman terms: it shoveled
                    bullshit.

                  <p>
                    The developer -- Pete Nykänen -- had opened an issue with
                    the company on Github, but no action was taken.
                  </p>

                    and found that the story was true. What's more, the bogus
                    content ended up number one in Google's search results, and
                    pretty high-up almost everywhere else too. Intrigued, El Reg
                    investigators asked both the Google and the original AI

                    How they're going to do that -- given their proven ability
                    in planning ahead and stuff -- is probably merely a question
                    of filling in the blanks when asking the question to their
                    own AI engine, one supposes.

                    Google was a bit slower in responding -- by about a month or

                    A new type of printed circuit board (PCB) could drastically
                    reduce the amount of electronic waste that ends up in
                    landfills. Although most PCBs are difficult to recycle, such
                    is not the case with this one, which partially turns into a
                    reusable jelly when necessary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among other components, PCBs typically incorporate a layer
                    of non-conductive fiberglass which serves as a substrate for
                    electronic parts such as chips, resistors and transformers.
                    The fiberglass is in turn made up of two ingredients – woven
                    glass fibers and epoxy resin – which are very difficult to
                    separate from one another.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because this substrate material can't be easily broken down,
                    retrieving the electronics for reuse is labor-intensive and
                    time-consuming. Sometimes the fiberglass is burned away in
                    order to harvest the electronics, but this process is
                    environmentally-unfriendly plus it may damage the very
                    components that it's freeing up.
                  </p>
                  <p>That's where the experimental new PCB comes in.</p>
                  <p>
                    Created by scientists from the University of Washington, it
                    replaces the resin in the fiberglass with a polymer known as
                    a vitrimer. As long as the PCB is in use, that vitrimer
                    remains strong, rigid and non-conductive, allowing the
                    substrate to function just like one made of traditional
                    fiberglass.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once such a "vPCB" (vitrimer printed circuit board) has
                    reached the end of its use, it will be sent to a recycling
                    facility and immersed in an organic solvent which has a
                    relatively low boiling point. When that solvent boils, it
                    causes the vitrimer to swell and become gelatinous.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All of the glass fibers and electronics – which remain
                    completely undamaged – can then be easily plucked out for
                    reuse. Additionally, lab experiments have shown that 98% of
                    the vitrimer itself can be reused, along with 91% of the
                    solvent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And importantly, vPCBs can be manufactured at existing
                    facilities, plus they can be recycled over and over again.
                    In fact, the scientists estimate that the use of recycled
                    vPCBs could entail a 48% reduction in global warming
                    potential and an 81% reduction in carcinogenic emissions as
                    compared to traditional PCBs.

                    Perhaps most significant is the discovery of five cursus
                    monuments. Cursus monuments are long, narrow earthwork
                    enclosures and are well-known from the Middle Neolithic in
                    Britain, but have not been well-studied in Ireland.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This discovery is one of the largest cursus clusters in both
                    Britain and Ireland, and infers that Baltinglass continued
                    to be intensively settled between the Early Neolithic and
                    late Bronze Age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This latest LIDAR survey greatly enhances of understanding
                    of the incredibly rich archaeological heritage of this part
                    of west Wicklow; reinforcing the significance of the
                    prehistoric landscape of the Baltinglass Hills area and
                    shining new light on rare and poorly understood monuments
                    like ceremonial cursus," states Deirdre Burns, Heritage
                    Officer at Wicklow County Council.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Importantly, these cursus monuments are clearly aligned with
                    burial monuments in the landscape, as well as the rising and
                    setting sun during major solar events such as the solstice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Dr. O'Driscoll, "This may have symbolized the
                    ascent of the dead into the heavens and their perceived
                    rebirth, with the cursus physically setting out the final
                    route of the dead, where they left the land of the living
                    and joined the ancestors beyond the visible horizon."

                Existing maps of the moon date back to the 1960s and 1970s. The
                new "Geologic Atlas of the Lunar Globe" took a decade in the
                making and is the work of over a hundred scientists. It depicts
                the moon in a scale of 1:2'500'000 which is twice as detailed
                compared to maps from the Apollo era. The maps are supposed to
                help future space missions. They are available in Chinese and
                English. A digital version for the scientific community is in
                the making

                    The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has released the
                    highest-resolution geological maps of the Moon yet. The
                    <em>Geologic Atlas of the Lunar Globe</em>, which took more
                    than 100 researchers over a decade to compile, reveals a
                    total of 12,341 craters, 81 basins and 17 rock types, along
                    with other basic geological information about the lunar
                    surface. The maps were made at the unprecedented scale of
                    1:2,500,000.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Every question in geology starts with looking at a
                    geological map," says Ross Mitchell, a geophysicist at the
                    CAS Institute of Geology and Geophysics in Beijing. The new
                    lunar atlas is "really a resource for the whole world", he
                    says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The CAS also released a book called
                    <em>Map Quadrangles of the Geologic Atlas of the Moon</em>,
                    comprising 30 sector diagrams which together form a
                    visualization of the whole Moon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] With the updated atlas, scientists will be able to
                    better understand the history of the Moon, evaluate
                    potential lunar resources and conduct comparative geological
                    studies. It will also inform the location choices of future
                    missions, including where to build a lunar research base,
                    Liu says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Liu says that his team has already started work to
                    improve the resolution of the maps, and will produce
                    regional maps of higher accuracy on the basis of scientific
                    and engineering needs. In the meantime, the completed atlas
                    has been integrated into a cloud platform called the Digital
                    Moon, and will eventually become available to the
                    international research community.

              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    One feature of electric vehicles we hear a lot about is
                    regenerative braking. Normally, the battery sends electrical
                    power to the motor, turns the wheels, and sends you down the
                    road. Regenerative braking effectively puts this system into
                    reverse, harnessing the rotation of your wheels to turn the
                    motor into a generator, sending power back to the battery
                    and recharging it. Anyone who's ridden a bicycle with a
                    small generator to power the lights has experienced how much
                    extra drag even a couple of light bulbs can put on the drive
                    system. It's far from a perpetual motion machine, but any
                    energy an EV can recover and put back into the battery to
                    extend its range is a benefit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, this presents another problem. Since regenerative
                    braking does not use the vehicle's standard braking system,
                    the brake lights don't need to be turned on, despite the
                    significant amount of deceleration regenerative braking can
                    provide. This came to light in a video by
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TechnologyConnections"
                      >Technology Connections</a
                    >
                    that demonstrated this issue on his Hyundai Ioniq 5, which
                    could use regenerative braking to aggressively slow almost
                    to a stop before turning on its brake lights. While the
                    American Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards do not
                    require EVs to light up the brake lights under regenerative
                    braking, they explicitly do not prohibit it, either.

                    [...] Electric motorcycles are not nearly as common as
                    electric cars at this point, but someday they may be. Their
                    capabilities are impressive, their range is improving, and
                    charging infrastructure will only get better. Like their
                    four-wheeled cousins, electric motorcycles also use
                    regenerative braking, which opens us up to being on the
                    receiving end of a crash by an inattentive driver who didn't
                    notice we were slowing down because our brake lights weren't
                    on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Until or unless such a change is made, we, as riders,
                    can make a small change in our behavior to ensure our safety
                    when using heavy regenerative braking. It may not be
                    necessary for braking purposes, but a light tap or drag on
                    either brake will manually turn on the brake light, letting
                    anyone behind us know we are slowing down. This is likely
                    the preferred riding technique anyway, but now has an
                    additional safety aspect from the lighting and visibility
                    perspective.

                    There was a strong linear relationship between companies'
                    annual production of plastic and their branded plastic

                    , I present research I conducted in China in 2019.
                    Specifically, the book is based on 58 semi-structured
                    in-depth interviews with Chinese participants recruited
                    through colleagues at three universities in Beijing,

                    [...] So, what about us? We, in Western liberal democracies,
                    are also exposed to digital surveillance. And our
                    surveillance ideas are also shaped by our own
                    socio-political, cultural, and economic contexts, with
                    significant variations across different Western societies.
                    My work suggests that some of our own privacy and
                    surveillance narratives are quite close to the Chinese ones,
                    while others clearly differ.

                    "Consequently, the reason why cryptochrome 4 is more
                    sensitive in robins than in chickens and pigeons must be
                    found in the protein's DNA sequence," says Langebrake, who
                    was the lead author. "The sequence was probably optimized by
                    evolutionary processes in these nocturnal migratory birds."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the current study, the team led by Langebrake and
                    Liedvogel, therefore, investigated magnetoreception from an
                    evolutionary perspective for the first time. The researchers
                    analyzed the cryptochrome 4 genes of 363 bird species
                    ranging from the little spotted kiwi to the song sparrow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, they compared the protein's evolutionary rate with
                    that of two related cryptochromes and found that the gene
                    sequences of the cryptochromes used for comparison were very
                    similar across all bird species: They appear to have changed
                    very little over the course of evolution. This is most
                    likely due to their key role in regulating the internal
                    clock—a mechanism that is essential for all birds and in
                    which modifications would have extremely negative effects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cryptochrome 4, by contrast, proved to have been highly
                    variable. "This suggests that the protein is important for
                    adaptation to specific environmental conditions," explains
                    Liedvogel, who is Professor of Ornithology at the University
                    of Oldenburg and director of the Institute of Avian
                    Research. The resulting specialization could be
                    magnetoreception. "A similar pattern has been observed in
                    other sensory proteins such as light-sensitive pigments in
                    the eye," she explains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers then took a closer look at how the gene
                    sequence for chryptochrome 4 has evolved in the evolutionary
                    history of birds. The results led the scientists to conclude
                    that, in particular, in the case of the passerine
                    (Passeriformes) order, the protein has been optimized
                    through rapid selection. "Our results indicate that
                    evolutionary processes could have led to cryptochrome 4
                    specializing as a magnetoreceptor in songbirds," says
                    Langebrake.

                    in May, the tech giant has laid off staff across key teams
                    like Flutter, Dart, Python and others, according to reports
                    from affected employees shared on social media. Google
                    confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch, but not the specific
                    teams, roles or how many people were let go.

                    biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead,"
                    said Google spokesperson Alex García-Kummert. "To best
                    position us for these opportunities, throughout the second
                    half of 2023 and into 2024, a number of our teams made
                    changes to become more efficient and work better, remove
                    layers, and align their resources to their biggest product
                    priorities. Through this, we're simplifying our structures
                    to give employees more opportunity to work on our most
                    innovative and important advances and our biggest company
                    priorities, while reducing bureaucracy and layers," he

                    The company clarified that the layoffs were not company-wide
                    but were reorgs that are part of the normal course of
                    business. Affected employees will be able to apply for other
                    open roles at Google, we're told.

                    The web has become so interwoven with everyday life that it
                    is easy to forget what an extraordinary accomplishment and
                    treasure it is. In just a few decades, much of human
                    knowledge has been collectively written up and made
                    available to anyone with an internet connection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But all of this is coming to an end. The advent of AI
                    threatens to destroy the complex online ecosystem that
                    allows writers, artists, and other creators to reach human
                    audiences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To understand why, you must understand publishing. Its core
                    task is to connect writers to an audience. Publishers work
                    as gatekeepers, filtering candidates and then amplifying the
                    chosen ones. Hoping to be selected, writers shape their work
                    in various ways. This article might be written very
                    differently in an academic publication, for example, and
                    publishing it here entailed pitching an editor, revising
                    multiple drafts for style and focus, and so on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The internet initially promised to change this process.
                    Anyone could publish anything! But so much was published
                    that finding anything useful grew challenging. It quickly
                    became apparent that the deluge of media made many of the
                    functions that traditional publishers supplied even more
                    necessary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The arrival of generative-AI tools has introduced a
                    voracious new consumer of writing. Large language models, or
                    LLMs, are trained on massive troves of material—nearly the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/01/artificial-intelligence-ai-chatgpt-dall-e-2-learning/672754/"
                      >entire internet</a
                    >
                    in some cases. They digest these data into an immeasurably
                    complex network of probabilities, which enables them to
                    synthesize seemingly new and intelligently created material;
                    to write code, summarize documents, and answer direct
                    questions in ways that can appear human.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These LLMs have begun to disrupt the traditional
                    relationship between writer and reader. Type how to fix
                    broken headlight into a search engine, and it returns a list
                    of links to websites and videos that explain the process.
                    Ask an LLM the same thing and it will just tell you how to
                    do it. Some consumers may see this as an improvement: Why
                    wade through the process of following multiple links to find
                    the answer you seek, when an LLM will neatly summarize the
                    various relevant answers to your query? Tech companies have
                    proposed that these conversational, personalized answers are
                    the future of information-seeking. But this supposed
                    convenience will ultimately come at a huge cost for all of
                    us web users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] If we continue in this direction, the web—that
                    extraordinary ecosystem of knowledge production—will cease
                    to exist in any useful form. Just as there is an entire
                    industry of scammy SEO-optimized websites trying to entice
                    search engines to recommend them so you click on them, there
                    will be a similar industry of AI-written, LLMO-optimized
                    sites. And as audiences dwindle, those sites will drive good
                    writing out of the market. This will ultimately degrade
                    future LLMs too: They will not have the human-written
                    training material they need to learn how to repair the
                    headlights of the future.

                    [...] Kamsma underscores the fundamental nature of the
                    research, highlighting that iontronic neuromorphic
                    computing, while experiencing rapid growth, is still in its
                    infancy. The envisioned outcome is a computer system vastly
                    superior in efficiency and energy consumption compared to
                    present-day technology. However, whether this vision will
                    materialize remains speculative at this juncture.
                    Nevertheless, Kamsma views the publication as a significant
                    step forward.

                    to locate a test phone after paying $300 to a bounty hunter
                    who simply bought the data through a little-known
                    third-party service.

                    Sen. Wyden said no one who signed up for a cell plan thought
                    they were giving permission for their phone company to sell
                    a detailed record of their movements to anyone with a credit
                    card.

                    "I applaud the FCC for following through on my investigation
                    and holding these companies accountable for putting
                    customers' lives and privacy at risk," Wyden said in a
                    statement today.

                    The FCC fined Sprint and T-Mobile $12 million and $80
                    million respectively. AT&amp;T was fined more than $57
                    million, while Verizon received a $47 million penalty.
                    Still, these fines represent a tiny fraction of each
                    carrier's annual revenues. For example, $47 million is less
                    than one percent of Verizon's total wireless service revenue
                    in 2023, which was nearly $77 billion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fine amounts vary because they were calculated based in
                    part on the number of days that the carriers continued
                    sharing customer location data after being notified that
                    doing so was illegal (the agency also considered the number
                    of active third-party location data sharing agreements). The
                    FCC notes that AT&amp;T and Verizon each took more than 320
                    days from the publication of the Times story to wind down
                    their data sharing agreements; T-Mobile took 275 days;
                    Sprint kept sharing customer location data for 386 days.

                    Don't get me wrong, it's absolutely brilliant that Microsoft
                    was able to release a fairly complete (minus DOSSHELL)
                    source code for MS-DOS 4.00 or 4.01 (see below). As much as
                    it was hated, DOS 4.0 was an important milestone and DOS 5.0
                    was much more similar to DOS 4.0 than not. This source code
                    will be an excellent reference of modern-ish DOS until
                    Microsoft officially releases the long ago leaked MS-DOS 6.0
                    source code. The source code includes all required build
                    tools, which makes building it (compared to many other
                    source releases) extremely easy.

                    [...] The researchers noted that the zombie worm has
                    remained susceptible to takeover by any threat actor who
                    gains control of the IP address or manages to insert itself
                    into the pathway between the server at that address and an
                    infected device. That threat poses interesting dilemmas for
                    the governments of affected countries. They could choose to
                    preserve the status quo by taking no action, or they could
                    activate a self-delete command built into the worm that
                    would disinfect infected machines. Additionally, if they
                    choose the latter option, they could elect to disinfect only
                    the infected machine or add new functionality to disinfect
                    any infected USB drives that happen to be connected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because of how the worm infects drives, disinfecting them
                    risks deleting the legitimate data stored on them. On the
                    other hand, allowing drives to remain infected makes it
                    possible for the worm to start its proliferation all over
                    again. Further complicating the decision-making process, the
                    researchers noted that even if someone issues commands that
                    disinfect any infected drives that happen to be plugged in,
                    it's inevitable that the worm will live on in drives that
                    aren't connected when a remote disinfect command is issued.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Given the potential legal challenges that could arise from
                    conducting a widespread disinfection campaign, which
                    involves sending an arbitrary command to workstations we do
                    not own, we have resolved to defer the decision on whether
                    to disinfect workstations in their respective countries to
                    the discretion of national Computer Emergency Response Teams
                    (CERTs), Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), and cybersecurity
                    authorities," the researchers wrote. "Once in possession of
                    the disinfection list, we can provide them an access to
                    start the disinfection for a period of three months. During
                    this time, any PlugX request from an Autonomous System
                    marked for disinfection will be responded to with a removal
                    command or a removal payload."

                    The concept of underwater laser propulsion isn't new.
                    Japanese researchers first considered it more than twenty

                Except... Google doesn't seem to know about the Japanese work,

                    Lasers are used to generate plasma inside water, which is
                    then used to make a detonation wave by plasma expansion. The
                    detonation wave is used to propel a craft or weapon ahead.

                    [...] A research team led by Ge Yang, a professor at the
                    School of Engineering at Harbin University, has now found a
                    way to improve the efficiency of laser propellers using a
                    coating of optical fibers – also referred to as underwater
                    fiber laser-induced plasma detonation wave propulsion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using this approach, the researchers claim to be able to
                    generate 70,000 newtons of thrust using just two megawatts
                    of laser power. The thrust generated is similar to that of a
                    commercial jet engine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to generating thrust, the laser also vaporizes
                    the seawater close to the vessel, creating bubbles on the
                    submarine's surface and reducing water resistance. This
                    phenomenon, known as supercavitation, could potentially
                    allow submarines to travel at supersonic speeds underwater.

                Would that be supersonic airspeed? If so, adjusted for depth

                    Wet wipes containing plastic will be banned across the UK to
                    reduce marine litter. The supply and sale of wet wipes
                    containing plastic will be banned following overwhelming
                    support during public consultation, with 95% of respondents
                    agreeing or strongly agreeing with the proposals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Measures have been set out in a joint response by all four
                    UK nations published today, including a transition period
                    for businesses to help them prepare. The four nations all
                    launched a consultation on the ban of the products last
                    autumn and today's announcement is a response to that
                    review.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ban will be brought through separately by each of the
                    UK's governments. Wet wipes frequently litter Britain's
                    beaches and eventually break down into microplastics, which
                    contribute to water pollution and damage ecosystems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Welsh Government said its ban would come into
                    force by June 2026. Scotland said it would introduce
                    regulations later this year with the aim of a ban taking
                    effect by the middle of 2026. Steve Barclay said in England
                    the legislation would be fast tracked and shops given an
                    18-month deadline to comply by the middle of 2026.

                    Russia vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution
                    Wednesday that would have reaffirmed a nearly 50-year-old
                    ban on placing weapons of mass destruction into orbit, two

                    Russia has veto power over any resolution that comes before
                    the body. China abstained from the vote, and 13 other
                    members of the Security Council voted in favor of the
                    resolution.

                    President Putin say publicly that Russia has no intention of

                    This Russian direct ascent ASAT test followed demonstrations
                    of similar capability by China, the United States, and
                    India. Russia's military has also demonstrated satellites
                    over the last decade that could grapple onto an adversary's
                    spacecraft in orbit, or fire a projectile to take out an
                    enemy satellite.

                    So, the researchers examined whether EVs extracted from
                    cow's milk could be used as a means of delivering drugs to
                    the problematic gastrointestinal tract. Milk EVs (mEVs) have
                    <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/9/2589"
                      >previously been investigated</a
                    >
                    for their therapeutic potential in irritable bowel disease
                    (IBD) in mouse models.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After they'd confirmed that the mEVs crossed the intestinal
                    wall using realistic organoid models of human intestines,
                    the researchers loaded the mEVs with anti-tumor necrosis
                    factor alpha (anti-TNF-a) RNA and administered a single dose
                    to a rat model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). TNF-a
                    mediates the intestinal inflammatory process and is one of
                    the main factors implicated in the development of IBD. The
                    treatment reduced the length of a major site of colon
                    inflammation in the rats compared to controls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The significant improvement in the appearance of the colon
                    in the treated group suggested that mEVs successfully
                    delivered functional anti-TNF-a RNA cargo, thereby reducing
                    inflammation and promoting repair of the colon wall.
                    Although the study only considered the effect of RNA-loaded
                    mEVs on IBD, the researchers say the mEVs could be used to
                    treat a broad range of diseases, including heart diseases
                    and diabetes, using orally administered therapeutics.

                    "This could lead to the disruptive and sustainable
                    manufacturing of affordable and accessible oral nucleic acid
                    therapies for a plethora of diseases, leading to great
                    societal impacts," Vllasaliu said.

                    those preservationists continue to face pushback from
                    industry trade groups, who worry that an exemption would

                    that found a whopping 87 percent of games ever released are
                    out of print, making it difficult for researchers to get
                    access to huge swathes of video game history without
                    institutional help. And the games of most interest to
                    researchers are less likely to have had modern re-releases,
                    since they tend to be the "more primitive" early games with
                    "less popular appeal," Salvador said.

                    The Copyright Office is expected to rule on the preservation
                    community's proposed exemption later this year. But for the
                    moment, there is some frustration that the industry has not
                    been at all receptive to the significant compromises the
                    preservation community feels it has made on these potential
                    concerns.

                    the first major new hard drive technology in a decade, and
                    the much less enviable position of proving the reliability
                    of the first major new hard drive technology in a decade.
                    Due to HAMR's use of temporal heating with its platters, as
                    well as all-new read/write heads, HAMR introduces multiple
                    new changes at once that have raise questions about how
                    reliable the technology will be. Looking to address these
                    matters (and further promote their HAMR drives),

                    outlining the company's R&amp;D efforts, and why the company
                    expects their HAMR drives to last several years – as long or
                    longer than current PMR hard drives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the company, the reliability of Mozaic 3+
                    drives on par with traditional drives relying on
                    perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR), the company says. In
                    fact, components of HAMR HDDs have demonstrated a 50%
                    increase in reliability over the past two years. Seagate
                    says that Mozaic 3+ drives boast impressive durability
                    metrics: their read/write heads have demonstrated capacity
                    to handle over 3.2 petabytes of data transfer over 6,000
                    hours of operation, which exceeds data transfers of typical
                    nearline hard drives by 20 times. Accordingly, Seagate is
                    rating these drives for a mean time between failure (MTBF)
                    2.5 million hours, which is in-line with PMR-based drives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Based on their field stress tests, involving over 500,000
                    Mozaic 3+ drives, Seagate says that the heads of Mozaic 3+
                    drives will last over seven years, surpassing the typical
                    lifespan of current PMR-based drives. Generally, customers
                    anticipate that modern PMR drives will last between four and
                    five years with average usage, so these drives would exceed
                    current expectations.

                    A huge heart-shaped feature on the surface of Pluto has
                    intrigued astronomers since NASA's New Horizons spacecraft
                    captured it in a 2015 image. Now, researchers think they
                    have solved the mystery of how the distinctive heart came to
                    be — and it could reveal new clues about the dwarf planet's
                    origins.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The feature is called Tombaugh Regio in honor of astronomer
                    Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered Pluto in 1930. But the heart
                    is not all one element, scientists say. And for decades,
                    details on Tombaugh Regio's elevation, geological
                    composition and distinct shape, as well as its highly
                    reflective surface that is a brighter white than the rest of
                    Pluto, have defied explanation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Through new research on Sputnik Planitia, an
                    international team of scientists has determined that a
                    cataclysmic event created the heart. After an analysis
                    involving numerical simulations, the researchers concluded a
                    planetary body about 435 miles (700 kilometers) in diameter,
                    or roughly twice the size of Switzerland from east to west,
                    likely collided with Pluto early in the dwarf planet's
                    history.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Pluto's core is so cold that the (rocky body that
                    collided with the dwarf planet) remained very hard and did
                    not melt despite the heat of the impact, and thanks to the
                    angle of impact and the low velocity, the core of the
                    impactor did not sink into Pluto's core, but remained intact
                    as a splat on it," said lead study author Dr. Harry
                    Ballantyne, research associate at the University of Bern in
                    Switzerland, in a statement.

                    People are surprised to learn that Mari Murdock, 36, is a
                    professional game master, a role in which she organizes and
                    narrates tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons &amp;
                    Dragons.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "A lot of people don't see things like hobbies or artistic
                    endeavors as something that could generally make them
                    money," she tells CNBC Make It.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Admittedly, she didn't expect running D&amp;D games to turn
                    into a paying gig, either — at least at first: "It was just
                    a hobby I did with my friends in college."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Since 2021, Murdock's main source of income has been
                    working as a GM for
                    <a href="https://dungeonmasterdirect.com/"
                      >Dungeon Master Direct</a
                    >, a Utah-based company that specializes in online and
                    in-person tabletop roleplaying game sessions that

                      >range from $375 to $750</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Even if she didn't do it for a living, Murdock says
                    she'd still be planning D&amp;D campaigns for friends,
                    reading game books or writing fiction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since hobbies can become side hustles, "it's important to
                    remember that creative work is work," she says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "I run about three games a week on a busy week," says
                    Murdock. Each ongoing game, including prep, takes about four
                    to five hours a week of her time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She also helps run company events, like the largest game of
                    Dungeons &amp; Dragons ever played,
                    <a

                      >according to Guinness World Records</a
                    >. The game was held at a mall in Provo, Utah, and
                    culminated in all 1,227 participants defeating an evil
                    wizard named Vecna in the final attack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Despite the fantastical elements of Dungeons &amp;
                    Dragons, Murdock says her interest in gaming has not been
                    discouraged by her church. In fact, "a lot of members of the
                    LDS church gravitate toward fantasy games," she says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Attitudes have change since the
                    <a

                      >"satanic panic" of the 1980s</a
                    >, where people had "this stereotype that kids in their
                    basements were actually summoning these demons and things
                    like that," she says.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Murdock, gaming allows you to immerse yourself in "a
                    pretend situation where you are imagining that you are
                    someone else. I think that really develops creativity. It
                    creates problem solving and a lot of empathy."

                  <p>
                    But it appears the airport computer system is unable to
                    process a birth date so far in the past - so it defaulted to
                    one 100 years later instead.

                    The former nurse, who flies every year to see family and
                    escape the cold winters, says on both occasions staff at
                    American Airlines were kind and helpful, in spite of the
                    confusion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    American Airlines has not responded to a request for
                    comment.

                  <p>
                    The centenarian says she would like it to be fixed. On a
                    previous flight, Patricia and her daughter were waiting
                    inside the plane after other passengers had left, as airport
                    staff had not arranged a wheelchair for her.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She says having her real age acknowledged would also be
                    beneficial for Kris.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I would like them to fix the computer as my poor daughter
                    had to carry all our luggage and apparel almost a mile from
                    one gate to the other," she said.
                  </p>
                  <p>Next trip</p>
                  <p>
                    Patricia travelled solo until she was 97, but has been
                    reliant on help from her family since then.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I have some trouble with my eyesight now so I wouldn't want
                    to do it on my own," she said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But she is adamant the IT problems will not put her off
                    flying, and says she is looking forward to her next flight
                    in the autumn.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By then she will be 102 - and perhaps by then the airline
                    computers will have caught on to her real age.
