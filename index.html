                    The chip continues to receive excessive current through the
                    motherboard socket during this death spiral of sorts, thus
                    leading to the visible damage we can see in the socket to
                    the vCore pins and the bulging on the chip's LGA pads.
                    However, less visible damage also extends to the CPU SoC,
                    CPU_VDDCR_SOC, and CPU VDD MISC rails/pins â€” they just don't
                    pull enough current to leave visible scorching like we see
                    with the vCore pins.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We do know that 1.25V is the recommended safe SoC voltage
                    limit, and we're told that 1.4V and beyond definitely
                    increases the <em>likelihood</em> of the condition
                    occurring. To be clear, running beyond 1.4V doesn't ensure
                    that your chip will burn out, but your odds will increase.
                    Conversely, 1.35V appears to be "safe." Proceed at your own
                    risk, though.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our sources say that AMD is working on a fix that includes a
                    voltage cap or lock in the firmware/SMU, which should
                    prevent EXPO memory profiles and simple BIOS manipulations
                    from exceeding an as-yet-undefined limit. We're also told
                    that AMD can't completely prevent SoC voltage manipulations
                    because the amount fed to the chip is dictated by the VRMs,
                    leaving a means for crafty motherboard vendors to allow
                    voltage changes despite AMD's lock (this would not be the
                    first time motherboard vendors have circumvented limits to
                    offer rare functionalities).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A few motherboard vendors, like ASUS and MSI, have already
                    issued new BIOSes to correct some of the issues. However, we
                    have confirmed that failures have also occurred on Biostar,
                    ASRock, and Gigabyte boards, so all vendors are impacted to
                    some degree.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As with all forms of overclocking, any damage from using an
                    EXPO overclocking profile is not covered by your warranty,
                    but given the situation, we don't think that AMD or the
                    motherboard vendors would use the lack of warrantied EXPO
                    support to invalidate warranties.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The advertised performance you get from an EXPO profile is
                    also not guaranteed by the chipmaker. It's also noteworthy
                    that AMD's purportedly planned SoC voltage cap could lead to
                    lower stable memory overclocking frequencies. However, we
                    don't think that will matter too much to most Ryzen 7000
                    owners, as the sweet spot DDR5-6000 should work just fine
                    within the proposed limits. However, extreme overclockers
                    and those pushing the very bleeding edge of performance
                    could end up with lower overclocking limits. Time will tell.

                    Makers of these tinkly eyedrops claim they can treat eye
                    conditions, namely dry eyes and inflammation. Any such
                    biologic-based product claiming to cure or treat a condition
                    is regulated by the FDA under the Public Health Service Act
                    and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. As such, these
                    products require an investigational new drug application (an
                    IND) to be tested in humans and a full FDA approval before
                    hitting the market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This appears to have been news to at least two companies
                    that the FDA sent warning letters to late last year. The
                    companies,
                    <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/162219/download"
                      >Regener-Eyes</a

                    <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/163465/download"
                      >M2 Biologics</a
                    >
                    [PDF], were illegally selling unapproved eye drops, which
                    the FDA said contained amniotic-fluid, to treat dry eyes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In fact, there is not a single amniotic-fluid eye drop
                    product approved by the FDA, and any such product used under
                    an IND requires patients to sign consent forms. Yet, the FDA
                    is finding these products on the market, the regulator said
                    in its notification.

                Wait, what? Amniotic fluid? Whether it works or not (probably
                not), I want to know how these companies can harvest enough to
                make commercial quantities of their products.

                    To see these dips in brightness, though, you need to observe
                    the star in question at several different points. First, you
                    need to see the star at its usual brightness, then during
                    the transit, then after the transit. And scientists like to
                    observe these transits multiple times so they can be sure
                    that what they are seeing is definitely due to the presence
                    of a planet and not another factor. That's why TESS gathers
                    so much data â€” because it needs to observe lots of stars and
                    see them at multiple points in time to know whether they
                    have planets orbiting them.

                    mission and is now on its extended mission, but it continues
                    to operate well so we can expect it to continue discovering
                    many more exoplanets in the years to come.

                    Imagine the horrified looks you'd get if you dropped your
                    paper coffee cup on the ground, stepped on it and walked
                    away. A startup based in San Francisco and Germany says you
                    can do exactly that with its cups, guilt-free.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <a href="https://gaeastar.com/">GaeaStar</a> is getting
                    ready to introduce its 3D-printed, disposable clay cups to
                    the US, after a successful trial period at coffee shops and
                    ice cream parlors in Berlin. Watch the video above to learn
                    more.

                    The cups are made from just three ingredients: dirt, salt
                    and a small amount of water. Founder and CEO Sanjeev
                    Mankotia told CNET he had the idea when he was visiting
                    family in India and his cousin was drinking chai from a
                    terracotta cup she bought from a street vendor. "She drank
                    the cup, and then smashed it on the ground. And I was like,
                    'You're throwing something away that's creating litter.' And
                    her reaction was, "It's made out of dirt, why is this an
                    issue?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Those terracotta cups, or "Kuhlars" have been used in South
                    Asia for 5,000 years. They are typically never reused.

                    [...] According to GaeaStar, it can print a ceramic cup
                    using about 60% less energy than it takes to create a
                    plastic or paper cup, for about the same price. "When you
                    scale it up, we feel that this could be priced in parallel
                    or comparable to the incumbent cups in the market, if not
                    cheaper."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] GaeaStar's long-term goal is to put its patent-pending
                    3D-printers in shops around the US, where cups could be
                    printed on-demand in about 10 seconds. Mankotia says dirt
                    can be sourced locally to save energy. In the meantime,

                    Imagine a movie about a rogue employee who breaches security
                    in a company that implants chips inside half of the world's
                    computers. They embed a Trojan in systems around the globe
                    and hold the world to ransom.

                  <p>
                    This is not unimaginable, says Rajat Kumar, a Ph.D. student
                    in Yehia Massoud's lab at KAUST. "A single company currently
                    supplies more than half of the world's chips, and nearly all
                    of the most advanced chips," he confirms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Massoud's group researches emerging technology that could
                    make chips more secure. A recent project reports
                    multifunctional logic gates that offer users a range of
                    hardware security advantages. These include better control
                    over their devices, tamper protection, watermarking and
                    fingerprinting, and layout camouflage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Even if a semiconductor foundry is highly trustworthy, an
                    untrusted entity in the supply chain could tamper with
                    chips," Massoud says.

                    [...] As a secure alternative, Kumar and colleagues explored
                    polymorphic gates made from nanoscale structures consisting
                    of an oxide layer sandwiched between two ferromagnetic
                    layers. These structures, known as a magnetic tunnel
                    junctions (MTJ), are easily switchable by reversing the
                    relative orientation of magnetic spins of the ferromagnetic
                    layers. This spin-based control makes MTJs examples of
                    spintronic devices.

                  <p>
                    Kumar and colleagues thought the switchable properties of
                    MTJs meant that they could be used to create polymorphic
                    gates, whose configuration users could check and
                    reconfigure, overwriting any nefarious settings. They showed
                    that MTJs function as polymorphic gates in a way that
                    prevents tampering and intellectual property piracy due to
                    their symmetry at both circuit and layout level symmetry,
                    obscuring their layout and making them hard to reverse

                    >, researchers report April 11 in
                    <em>Advanced Functional Materials</em>. The team made a
                    self-healing leather from mushrooms' threadlike structures
                    called mycelium, building on past iterations of the material
                    to allow it to fix itself.

                  <p>
                    Mycelium leather is already an emerging product, but it's
                    produced in a way that extinguishes fungal growth. Elise
                    Elsacker and colleagues speculated that if the production
                    conditions were tweaked, the mycelium could retain its
                    ability to regrow if damaged.

                  <p>

                    rich in proteins, carbohydrates and other nutrients. A skin
                    formed on the surface of the liquid, which the scientists
                    scooped off, cleaned and dried to make a thin, somewhat
                    fragile leather material. They used temperatures and
                    chemicals mild enough to form the leather but leave parts of
                    the fungus functional. Left dormant were chlamydospores,
                    little nodules on the mycelium that can spring back to life
                    and grow more mycelium when conditions are prime.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After punching holes in the leather, the researchers doused
                    the area in the same broth used to grow it to revive the
                    chlamydospores. The mycelium eventually regrew over the
                    punctures. Once healed, the hole-punched areas were just as
                    strong as undamaged areas â€” however, the repairs were
                    visible from one side of the leather.

                    After five long months journeying through space, ispace's
                    Hakuto-R lander is ready to greet the lunar surface.The
                    Japanese company is expecting to land Hakuto-R at
                    <b>12:40 PM EST today</b>. If successful, this first mission
                    will no doubt be a huge boon for ispace's ambitious plans to
                    send two subsequent landers to the moon in 2024 and 2025. It
                    would also make them the first private company to land on
                    the moon, and the first spacecraft from Japan to do so.
                    (China, the United States, and the USSR have been the only
                    nations to reach the lunar surface.)This first mission,
                    appropriately named Mission 1, kicked off last December when
                    a SpaceX Falcon 9 launched the lander into space. Since
                    then, the lander has performed a number of maneuvers to stay
                    on track in its path to the moon. At its farthest point,
                    Hakuto-R traveled as much as 1.4 million kilometers from
                    Earth.

                If I understand it correctly, researchers made a vaccine that
                targets the proteins common to all flu viruses instead of the
                part that changes every year. They tested it on 52 people and
                found it safe and effective.

                    Scientists at NIAID's Vaccine Research Center (VRC) report
                    in two new studies that an experimental influenza vaccine,
                    designed to elicit immunity against a broad range of
                    influenza viruses, performed well in a small trial of
                    volunteers. In fact, the vaccine has advanced to a second
                    trial led by scientists at Duke University through NIAID's
                    Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers (CIVICs).

                    In a phase 1 clinical trial of 52 volunteers, the vaccine
                    developed by the VRC â€“ known as H1ssF (influenza H1
                    hemagglutinin stabilized stem ferritin nanoparticle vaccine)
                    â€“ was safe, well-tolerated, and induced broad antibody
                    responses that target the hemagglutinin stem. The two new
                    studies assessing the nanoparticle vaccine published April

                    Linux 6.3 has arrived after a push that project boss Linus
                    Torvalds characterized as "a nice, controlled release cycle"
                    that required the seven release candidates he prefers and
                    was supported by helpful developer behavior.

                  <p>
                    "It happens," he added, but also didn't rule out "something
                    nasty couldn't have been lurking all these weeks." Torvalds

                    Holidays and travel are often the cause of delays to kernel
                    releases. Easter didn't slow development this time around.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Version 6.3 won't be a long term support (LTS) release â€“ the
                    last of those was Linux 6.1, and every fifth or sixth
                    release gets LTS status. So while many users will be pleased
                    to see it, 6.3 almost certainly won't be a cut of the kernel
                    that demands adoption or attention.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Which is not to say it doesn't include some interesting
                    goodies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among the additions are better support for multi-actuator
                    hard disk drives. Conventional hard disks have one actuator
                    driving a single set of read/write heads. Multi-actuator
                    disks add a second set of heads, which speeds things up
                    nicely. Hyperscale cloud operators are the first big buyers
                    of multi-actuator disks, but they're slowly going
                    mainstream. Now Linux is better able to handle them.

                    China's Loongson makes RISC-V processors and is working hard
                    and fast to make them an enterprise contender. Linux 6.3
                    will help that a little by supporting Kernel Address Space
                    Layout Randomization on the company's silicon. This has been
                    around on other architectures for ages â€“ security is helped
                    by having the kernel load into different areas of memory
                    each time it boots, instead of using the same locations and
                    giving attackers a known target.

                    To determine whether the fallacy necessarily involves
                    language and whether it is unique to humans, GonzÃ¡lez
                    engaged rats in a physical, not social, task. With
                    psychology professor Aaron Blaisdell, she designed two
                    experiments that required the rats to judge the likelihood
                    of just a sound being present or both a light and sound
                    being present in order to receive a food reward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The tendency to overestimate the likelihood that both
                    sound and light were present, even if it meant no reward,
                    demonstrates that, like humans, rats can show a conjunction
                    fallacy, the authors said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Until now, researchers said this is unique to human
                    cognition only because we haven't looked for it in animals,"
                    Blaisdell said. "If humans and other animals consider
                    alternative states of the world during ambiguous situations
                    to help decision-making, we might expect systematic biases
                    such as the conjunction fallacy to show a broader
                    distribution in the animal kingdom."

                <div>
                  <p>BuzzFeed News is shutting down.</p>
                  <p>
                    In an email to staff shared with NBC News, BuzzFeed CEO
                    Jonah Peretti said the move was part of a 15% workforce
                    reduction across a number of teams.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "While layoffs are occurring across nearly every division,
                    we've determined that the company can no longer continue to
                    fund BuzzFeed News as a standalone organization," he wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Peretti said he had "overinvest[ed] in BuzzFeed News
                    "because I love their work and mission so much."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This made me slow to accept that the big platforms wouldn't
                    provide the distribution or financial support required to
                    support premium, free journalism purpose-built for social
                    media," he wrote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He added that he had failed to "hold the company to higher
                    standards for profitability" to give it a buffer for
                    downturns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moving forward, BuzzFeed will have a lone news brand,
                    HuffPost, which BuzzFeed acquired in 2020 and which Peretti
                    said "is profitable, with a loyal direct front page
                    audience."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] BuzzFeed News launched in earnest at the outset of
                    2012 after it named longtime New York City political
                    reporter Ben Smith as its editor-in-chief. In 2021, the news
                    organization won a Pulitzer Prize for a series exposing
                    China's mass detention of Muslims. That same year, it was
                    also named a Pulitzer finalist â€” the second time it had
                    received the honor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Later that year, BuzzFeed Inc. became a publicly traded
                    company amid a global frenzy of reverse mergers, many of
                    which have since lost significant value. In BuzzFeed's case,
                    it never traded above its initial public offering price of
                    about $10.

                    Driving in thick fog is a big enough challenge for humans,
                    but it turns out self-driving cars find it pretty tricky,

                    Overwhelmed by dense fog in San Francisco early on Tuesday
                    morning, five of Waymo's fully driverless vehicles suddenly
                    parked by the side of a residential street in what appeared
                    to be a precautionary measure, the San Francisco Chronicle

                    of the street, the news outlet said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other vehicles were unable to pass as "baffled motorists
                    flashed headlights and tried to maneuver around the jam,"
                    the Chronicle said.

                  <p>
                    The traffic problems persisted until the fog cleared and the
                    autonomous cars were able to resume their journeys.

                    [...] Ninety percent of the viruses found by the researchers
                    are bacterial viruses â€“ known as bacteriophages. These
                    viruses have bacteria as their hosts and do not attack the
                    children's own cells, meaning that they do not cause
                    disease. The hypothesis is that bacteriophages primarily
                    serve as allies:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We work from the assumption that bacteriophages are largely
                    responsible for shaping bacterial communities and their
                    function in our intestinal system. Some bacteriophages can
                    provide their host bacterium with properties that make it
                    more competitive by integrating its own genome into the
                    genome of the bacterium. When this occurs, a bacteriophage
                    can then increase a bacterium's ability to absorb
                    <em>e.g</em>. various carbohydrates, thereby allowing the
                    bacterium to metabolise more things," explains Dennis
                    Sandris Nielsen, who continues:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The remaining ten percent of viruses found in the
                    children are eukaryotic â€“ that is, they use human cells as
                    hosts. These can be both friends and foes for us:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It is thought-provoking that all children run around with
                    10-20 of these virus types that infect human cells. So,
                    there is a constant viral infection taking place, which
                    apparently doesn't make them sick. We just know very little
                    about what's really at play. My guess is that they're
                    important for training our immune system to recognise
                    infections later. But it may also be that they are a risk
                    factor for diseases that we have yet to discover," says
                    Dennis Sandris Nielsen.

                    What ultimately initiated that disintegration isn't
                    completely clear, Dan Dumbacher, executive director of the
                    American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, told
                    Mashable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Now it's a pure race as to whether the aerodynamic pressure
                    breaks the vehicle up or the flight termination system
                    does," he said, "but it really doesn't matter because the
                    end result is the same."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As Starship ascended, cameras caught views of the array of
                    flames underneath it, appearing to show some of the engines
                    were out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "There's a lot of risk associated with this first launch, so
                    I would not say that it is likely to be successful," [Elon
                    Musk] said during a video conference with a National
                    Academies panel in 2021. "But I think we will make a lot of
                    progress."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite Starship never having reached space, industry
                    experts largely regarded the launch as a partial success
                    because the rocket managed to clear the launch tower and
                    traveled higher than any Starship prototype had before.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meanwhile, the general public seemed unsure of how to think
                    of the whole thing: After all, usually, when something big
                    and expensive goes boom, it's considered bad. But SpaceX has
                    always approached rocketry differently from NASA, working a
                    little messier and faster to achieve its goals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In terms of the explosive ending, Dumbacher said spaceport
                    safety officers are required to terminate a flight if a
                    rocket meanders into an area where the risk of debris
                    hitting someone on the ground could exceed a probability of
                    one in 30 million. "People ought to be looking at this as
                    good â€” the flight termination system, if it was needed,
                    actually worked," he said.

                    High-performance microprocessors tend to get hot and, when
                    overclocked without proper cooling or throttling, can
                    literally burn out When an old CPU does so in an old PC
                    because of dust and a worn out fan, there is nothing
                    surprising about it. But when a new CPU breaks on a shiny
                    new motherboard, that's surprising. This is what happened to

                    "The CPU pad is physically bulging," wrote Speedrookie, the
                    owner of the burned-out processor. "I imagine there was just
                    too much heat on the contacts causing the pad to expand. Not
                    that the CPU has an internal component which exploded."

                    At least when it comes to AMD's Ryzen 7000X3D-series

                    Famous overclocker der8auer also had an issue with an AMD

                    overclocking tests a few weeks ago. As you can see

                    especially right out of the BIOS."

                  <p>
                    There are about a million of reasons why a modern processor
                    can burn out. Defective sockets or a motherboards [sic] are
                    likely causes and insufficient cooling can cause a similar
                    result. A BIOS version that tends to automatically overclock
                    CPUs too much could be a yet another reason for a processor
                    failure. In fact, as noticed by HXL
                    <a
                      href="https://twitter.com/9550pro/status/1649621031588630529"
                      >(@9550pro</a
                    >), Asus has just withdrew old BIOSes for many of its AMD
                    X670-based motherboards, but for some of them old BIOSes are
                    still available.

                    [...] Again, given that the information is insufficient to
                    say the least, we cannot make any conclusions at this point.
                    We'll reach out to our contacts at AMD and the motherboard
                    vendors to see if they are aware of any issues. For now, we
                    recommend that those with AMD's Ryzen 7000X3D processors
                    keep a close eye on their CPU temps, use adequate cooling
                    and keep their BIOSes up-to-date.

                    16 micrograms is roughly equivalent to the mass of a grain
                    of sand, and that's a very fat cat on a quantum level. It's
                    "several billion times heavier than an atom or molecule,
                    making it the fattest quantum cat to date," according to the
                    release. It's not the first time physicists have tested
                    whether quantum behaviors can be observed in classical
                    objects. Last year, a different team declared they had
                    quantum-entangled a tardigrade, though a number of
                    physicists told Gizmodo that claim was poppycock.

                  <p>
                    This is slightly different, as the recent team was just
                    testing the mass of an object in a quantum state, not the
                    possibility of entangling a living thing. While that's not
                    in the team's plans, working with even larger masses "will
                    allow us to better understand the reason behind the
                    disappearance of quantum effects in the macroscopic world of
                    real cats," Chu said.

                    [...] As for the true boundary between the two worlds? "No
                    one knows," wrote Matteo Fadel, a physicist at ETH Zurich
                    and a co-author of the paper, in an email to Gizmodo.
                    "That's the interesting thing, and the reason why
                    demonstrating quantum effects in systems of increasing mass
                    is so groundbreaking."

                    The new research takes SchrÃ¶dinger's famous thought
                    experiment and gives it some practical applications.
                    Controlling quantum materials in superposition could be
                    useful in a number of fields that require very precise
                    measurements; for example, helping reduce noise in the
                    interferometers that measure gravitational waves.

                    The quantum world ripe for new discoveries, but alas, it's
                    crammed full of unknowables, dead ends, and vexing new
                    problems.

                    [...] The farmed mink in Poland again highlight the risk of
                    spillbacks by suggesting an unknown reservoir of SARS-CoV-2
                    in wild animals. In an investigation, researchers at
                    National Veterinary Research Institute and Erasmus
                    University Medical Centre looked into cases at three farms
                    within 8 km (about 5 miles) of each other. The first farm
                    reported two infected mink (out of 15 tested and about 8,650
                    animals total) on September 19, but they subsequently tested
                    negative and were pelted as scheduled. On November 16, a
                    second farm with 4,000 mink reported six infected animals
                    out of 15 tested, and they were pelted with precautions. The
                    third farm, with 1,100 mink, found 15 infected animals out
                    of 15 tested on January 18, but they subsequently tested
                    negative in two rounds of testing within 50 days. All of the
                    infected animals on the three farms were asymptomatic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers obtained eight whole genome sequencesâ€”four
                    each from the second and third farms; there wasn't enough
                    genetic material in samples from the first farm. The genome
                    sequences showed they were nearly identical and most closely
                    matched the lineage B.1.1.307, which hadn't been seen in
                    humans in Poland in over two years. The viruses also had 40
                    small genetic mutations, some of which have previously been
                    associated with circulation in mink, and could have been
                    acquired quickly. None of the farm families or workers
                    tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at any of the three farms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers noted that all three farms had concrete
                    fences 1.8 meters (6 feet) high and about 30â€“40 cm (around a
                    foot) deep. There was no evidence of animals burrowing under
                    the fences, but the researchers noted overhanging tree
                    branches that could have created a route for wild animals.
                    Interviews with owners and staff revealed that the farms
                    were occasionally visited by wild martens, weasel-like
                    carnivores. And there were also feral cats around. The
                    researchers tested feral cat droppings around the farms but
                    found they were negative for SARS-CoV-2.

                    This week, NASA signed a memorandum of understanding with
                    JAXA to join its upcoming mission to the two Martian moons,
                    Phobos and Deimos, which is scheduled to launch in 2024.
                    NASA has assembled a team of scientists and prepared two
                    instruments to board JAXA's spacecraft to Mars, the space

                    The Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission will not only
                    visit the two mysterious moons that whirl around Mars, it
                    will also land on the cratered surface of Phobos to snag a
                    sample from the largest of the two moons.

                  <p>
                    It's an ambitious plan as no spacecraft has successfully
                    ventured to the Martian moons before, let alone land on one.
                    JAXA, however, has some experience in returning samples from
                    cosmic bodies. The Japanese space agency's Hayabusa

                    [...] The main purpose of the mission is to analyze the
                    origins of the Martian moons and determine whether they are
                    in fact captured asteroids in the Mars system or fragments

                    To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the
                    folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny
                    world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more
                    kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve
                    and cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever

                    Magazines are so retro: If you are anything like me, you
                    probably remember the days when you subscribed to multiple
                    computing magazines. I still have fond memories of typing
                    out the computer programs in the back pages of some
                    publications; I even submitted a few of my own.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When high-speed internet came along, many computing
                    publications began producing digital versions of their
                    magazines online. Those with subscriptions still got their
                    physical copies, but the online component was a nice perk
                    for when readers could not just pick up a magazine and start
                    reading, like at work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Before long, most computing magazines had online versions
                    and, at some point, started ditching paper. It was easier
                    and cheaper to publish one copy that all subscribers could
                    access online rather than printing hundreds of thousands of
                    physical versions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The demise of print media in the computing industry
                    was inevitable. By the 2000s, many prominent magazines had
                    shut down their printing arms and switched to digital only.
                    Byte stopped printing in 1998. Windows Magazine crashed in
                    2002, and the succinctly titled PC Magazine (now PCMag)
                    published its last issue in 2009. Computer Gaming World went
                    entirely out of business with its November 2006 issue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Print advertising also played a big part in the
                    decline of computer publications. Once advertisers realized
                    replicating ads on web pages was cheap and easy, they
                    gradually pulled out of print computer magazines. Many
                    physical magazine branches shut down for that reason alone.
                    If the pub didn't have the clout of names like PC Magazine,
                    Maximum PC, or PC World, it had no chance of competing
                    against the internet for ad space. Even the almanac-like
                    Computer Shopper plunged from nearly 360,000 readers in 1996
                    to about 55,000 in 2014.

                    He added: "Remarkably, 80% of the mass in the universe is
                    invisible. By mapping the dark matter distribution across
                    the sky to the largest distances, our ACT lensing
                    measurements allow us to clearly see this invisible world."

                    [...] Sherwin added, "Our results also provide new insights
                    into an ongoing debate some have called 'The Crisis in
                    Cosmology.'" This "crisis" stems from recent measurements
                    that use a different background light, one emitted from
                    stars in galaxies rather than the CMB. These have produced
                    results that suggest the dark matter was not lumpy enough
                    under the standard model of cosmology and led to concerns
                    that the model may be broken. However, the ACT team's latest
                    results precisely assessed that the vast lumps seen in this
                    image are the exact right size.

                  <p>
                    "While earlier studies pointed to cracks in the standard
                    cosmological model, our findings provide new reassurance
                    that our fundamental theory of the universe holds true,"
                    said Frank Qu, lead author of one of the papers and a
                    Cambridge graduate student as well as a former Princeton

                    general, we don't have particularly good theory for
                    understanding how to deter non-state actors. A lot of the
                    deterrence theory [has] evolved out of Cold War nuclear
                    deterrence in the USSR, USA and the West. It is not really
                    configured the same way to think about non-state actors,
                    particularly those which have very decentralized, loose
                    non-hierarchical network command structures, which don't
                    lend themselves to influencing in the same way as a
                    traditional top-down military adversary."

                    The situation with AI-enhanced weapons was different from
                    earlier military analysis in that the private sector is way
                    ahead of government research, which was not the case with
                    physical threats, he said.

                    calling for a pause for at least six months in the training
                    of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. Signatories included
                    Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, and
                    IEEE computing pioneer Grady Booch.

                    But the prospect of a pause was wholly unrealistic, Payne
                    said. "It reflects the degree of societal unease about the
                    rapid pace of change that people feel is coming down the
                    tracks towards them. But I don't think it is a realistic

                    The demand for privacy is so high today that tech companies
                    who were once major data retailers have rebranded themselves
                    as privacy guardians. Meta, which was infamously embroiled
                    in the Cambridge Analytica scandal and has been tied to
                    other disturbing data-mining episodes, has since promised
                    features like E2E encrypted messagingâ€”in a bid to make
                    itself seem more privacy-friendly to users. Apple,
                    meanwhile, has made privacy one of the core tenets of its
                    brandâ€”famously rolling out a new tagline: "Privacy. That's
                    Apple," despite glaring violations that speak to the
                    contrary.

                  <p>
                    For Yen, these efforts don't cut a lot of ice. "Big Tech is
                    not going to be incentivizedâ€”from a business model
                    perspectiveâ€”to deliver the level of privacy that users
                    really expect," he said. "No matter what Zuck says, nothing
                    can change the fundamental fact that he makes money by
                    selling your data."

                    It is hard not to cherish the partnership of a slightly
                    older ThinkPad and OpenBSD. The ThinkPad X270 and OpenBSD
                    are both minimalist, robust, and customizable. Specifically,
                    the ThinkPad is minimalist with regard to features, robust
                    with regard to physical durability, and customizable with
                    regard to hardware repairability and replaceability. OpenBSD
                    is minimalist with regard to code, robust with regard to
                    security, and customizable with regard to every aspect of
                    the system. Further, since a healthy number of OpenBSD's
                    developers long have used ThinkPads (to the point that I
                    have read some jokes come out of members of their ranks like
                    'I may use any kind of laptop that I may like, as long as it
                    is a ThinkPad'), the operating system works brilliantly on
                    the laptop â€” both with their stock settings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall, installing and configuring OpenBSD -current on the
                    ThinkPad X270 was the simplest minimalist installation of
                    any operating system on any hardware that I ever have done,
                    even simpler than Debian GNU/Linux or my beloved FreeBSD
                    (and much simpler than a proprietary, dysfunctional
                    operating system Windows or MacOS). Was the total setup
                    process easier than, say, that of a GNU/Linux distribution
                    that uses the Calamares installer and comes preconfigured
                    with a huge array of GNU/Linux drivers? Well, no, it was
                    not, but that is not the point. OpenBSD is secure, nimble,
                    and customizable in an elegantly simple way that
                    interoperates smoothly with this small ThinkPad for my
                    mobile academic research and writing. Even in this
                    topsy-turvy era in which other popular desktop operating
                    systems are have many design choices for form over function,
                    OpenBSD comes as a serious, professional product that is
                    ready to let me focus on my work.

                    Sturdy, degradable materials made from plants and other
                    non-petroleum sources have come a long way in recent years.
                    For example, cornstarch-based packing peanuts disappear
                    simply by dousing them in water, and some utensils are based
                    on polymers synthesized from plant sugars. But those packing
                    peanuts can't be used to protect anything wet, and
                    plant-derived polymers still take a long time to break down.
                    One potential alternative is a new type of rigid material
                    designed from isomalt, which is a sugar alcohol rather than
                    a polymer. With isomalt, bakers can create breathtaking, but
                    brittle, structures for desserts, and then dissolve them
                    away quickly in water. So, Scott Phillips and colleagues
                    wanted to boost the sturdiness of isomalt with natural
                    additives to create a robust material that degrades
                    on-demand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers heated isomalt to a liquid-like state and
                    mixed in either cellulose, cellulose and sawdust, or wood
                    flour to produce three different materials. Then, using
                    commercial plastics manufacturing equipment, the materials
                    were extruded into small pellets and molded into various
                    objects, including balls, a dodecahedron, a chess piece and
                    flower-shaped saucers. All of the tested additives doubled
                    the strength of isomalt, creating materials that were harder
                    than plastics, including poly(ethylene terephthalate) (known
                    as PET) and poly(vinyl chloride) (known as PVC), but were
                    still lightweight. In experiments, samples dissolved in
                    water within minutes. And saucers made of the material, and
                    coated with a food grade shellac and cellulose acetate,
                    withstood being immersed in water for up to seven days.
                    However, once the saucers were broken and the coating
                    cracked, they rapidly disintegrated in water. The team also
                    repeatedly crushed, dissolved and recycled both coated and
                    uncoated objects into new ones that were still as strong as
                    the original items.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers say that the material could be used for
                    food-service items and temporary dÃ©cor, and then crushed and
                    sprayed with water to fall apart. But even if such items
                    were simply tossed into the trash or somehow got into the
                    environment, the slightest crack in the coating would start
                    their collapse into sugars and the plant-based additives,
                    which the researchers say might be good for soil.

                    Archaeologists have discovered the remains of an
                    1,800-year-old winery at the Villa of the Quintilii outside
                    of Rome. By the team's measure, the winery was designed as
                    much for the spectacle of wine-making as the practice
                    itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Decorated rooms around the winery appear to have hosted
                    guests who would observe the wine-making process, the
                    researchers found, and the finishes (including marble
                    floors) seem installed for appearances over practicality.
                    The team's research is published in Antiquity.

                    "Agricultural labor was romanticized by the ruling classes
                    of many ancient cultures, especially as it was often the
                    source of both their wealth and status," said Emlyn Dodd, a
                    researcher at the Institute of Classical Studies at the
                    University of London, in an Antiquity release.

                    [...] WaveOne has shown success in neural-network
                    compression of still images. In
                    <a href="https://wave-one.github.io/iframe_comparisons/"
                      >one comparison</a
                    >, WaveOne reconstructions of images were 5 to 10 times as
                    likely to be chosen over conventional codecs by a group of
                    independent users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the temporal correlation in video is much stronger than
                    the spatial correlation in an image and you must encode the
                    temporal domain extremely efficiently to beat the state of
                    the art.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "At the moment, the neural video encoders are not there
                    yet," said Yiannis Andreopoulos, a professor of data and
                    signal processing at University College London and chief
                    technology officer at
                    <a href="https://www.isize.co/">iSize Technologies</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Nonetheless, the industry appears to be moving toward
                    combining AI with conventional codecsâ€”rather than relying on
                    full neural-network compression.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For the time being, "AI and conventional technologies
                    will work in tandem," said Andreopoulos, in part, he said,
                    because conventional encoders are interpretable and can be
                    debugged. Neural networks are famously obscure "black
                    boxes." Whether in the very long term neural encoding will
                    beat traditional encoding, Andreopoulos added, is still an
                    open question.

                    is partnering with truckload carrier C.R. England to
                    autonomously ship Tyson Foods products between Dallas and
                    San Antonio, Texas.

                    A human safety operator will be present in the one dedicated
                    truck Kodiak is allocating to this pilot. Deliveries will
                    begin this month, according to the company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The pilot program is the latest in Kodiak's growing string
                    of paid partnerships with major carriers, and it further
                    demonstrates the startup's potential path to sustainability
                    and even profitability once it removes the human safety
                    driver from operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A spokesperson for Kodiak said the company aims to remove
                    the safety operator within the next couple of years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Kodiak says the partnership is not only emblematic of
                    how human-driven trucks and autonomous trucks can work
                    together, but it also provides a use case for autonomy as a
                    solution for moving perishable products in a timely manner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As part of the partnership, C.R. England is also
                    joining Kodiak's Partner Development Program, which is
                    Kodiak's way of working with carriers to help establish
                    autonomous freight operations and, hopefully, integrate
                    Kodiak's self-driving system into their fleet.

                  <p>
                    "Our intent is to be a 'one-stop shop' for customers,
                    whether they need their freight moved autonomously or not,"
                    said England.

                    To get good output from ChatGPT or another LLM, you usually
                    have to feed it several prompts. But what if you could just
                    give your AI bot a set of fairly broad goals at the start of
                    a session and then sit back while it generates its own set
                    of tasks to fulfill those goals? That's the idea behind
                    Auto-GPT, a new open-source tool that uses the OpenAI API
                    (same LLM as ChatGPT) to prompt itself, based on your
                    initial input.

                  <p>
                    We've already seen a number of Twitter users talk about how
                    they are using Auto-GPT for everything from creating
                    marketing plans to analyzing market data for investments to

                    >. Based on our hands-on experience, we can't say that it
                    always works well (we asked it to write a Windows 11 how-to
                    and the result was awful), but it's early days and some
                    tasks may work better than others.

                    If you want to try Auto-GPT on your computer, it is easy to
                    install, and while there are a few sticky points in the
                    process, we've found ways to work with them, or around them
                    to write this condensed guide on how to create your own
                    Auto-GPT AI to help you in your goals.

                    An animal bone fragment full of human-made pits hints at how
                    prehistoric people in Western Europe may have crafted
                    clothing.

                    >, researchers report April 12 in <em>Science Advances</em>.
                    They suggest that the bone fragment rested beneath animal
                    hide while an artisan pricked holes in the material,
                    possibly for seams. If so, it's the earliest-known tool of
                    its kind and predates eyed needles in the region by about
                    15,000 years.

                  <p>
                    Found at an archaeological site south of Barcelona, the
                    roughly 11-centimeter-long bone fragment contains 28
                    punctures scattered across one flat side, with 10 of them
                    aligned and fairly evenly spaced.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The marks don't seem to have been a notation system or
                    decoration, given that some holes are hard to see and the
                    bone fragment wasn't otherwise shaped, says archaeologist
                    Luc Doyon of the University of Bordeaux in France. He
                    thought leatherwork could have made the marks. But it wasn't
                    until he visited a cobbler shop and saw one of the artisan's
                    tools that the hypothesis solidified, guiding Doyon's next
                    steps.

                Europe. Temperatures there, averaged over the last 5 years, have

              </p>
              <p>
                Europe, at least, has a climate change service to measure these
                things. As for the rest of the world, an extrapolation of the
                pattern shown in
                <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/esotc/2022/globe-in-2022"

              <p>
                To illustrate the
                <a

                of the problem, the heatwave in mid-July of 2022 was caused by
                hot air from the Sahara moving into Europe, driving temperatures
                above 40 degrees Celsius. By mid-August, a stationary
                high-pressure system with clear skies and weak winds took hold,
                and caused a second heatwave, which was made worse due to the
                soil being dried out by the mid-July event, and no rains since.
              </p>
              <p>
                Events above the Sahara might have come a second time in play,
                here. Increasing temperatures lead to a stronger evaporation
                over sea, while the land heats up more. This results in a
                stronger temperature gradient, which draws rains deeper inland:
                heavier rainfalls now are reported in the central Sahara, in
                summer, with formerly dry valleys being put under four meters of
                water. This causes less Sahara dust in the atmosphere, and hence
                shields the land less from solar radiation: the EU's report
                mentions that 2022 surface solar radiation was the highest in a
                40 year record, and part of a positive trend.

                To end with a positive note, the EU ain't doing so bad, compared
                to Greenland: three different heatwaves in 2022, and an average
                September temperature more than 8 degrees Celsius higher than
                normal.

                    So Cholis and Iason Krommydas of Rice University in Houston
                    analyzed positrons detected by the Alpha Magnetic
                    Spectrometer on the International Space Station. The pair
                    found an excess of positrons whose present-day energies
                    could correspond to a burst of activity from the galactic
                    center between 3 million and 10 million years ago, right
                    around when the Fermi bubbles are thought to have formed,
                    Cholis said at the meeting.

                  <p>
                    The result, Cholis said, supports the idea that the Fermi
                    bubbles came from a time when the galaxy's central black
                    hole was busier than it is today.

                  <p>
                    As of mid-August 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce's
                    Bureau of Industry and Security mandated that any company
                    planning to sell semiconductor hardware, software,
                    equipment, or any other asset using American intellectual
                    property to Huawei and its entities must obtain a special
                    export license. The export controls on Huawei mostly pertain
                    to semiconductors. However, Seagate's hard drives also fall
                    under the export-controlled items category because they use
                    controllers and memory designed with electronic design
                    automation tools developed by American companies and
                    produced using U.S.-made equipment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These export licenses were subject to a presumption of
                    denial policy, meaning they were difficult to obtain.
                    However, multiple companies were granted appropriate
                    licenses between 2020 and 2022, which allowed Huawei to
                    acquire various products that were developed or manufactured
                    in the United States.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Seagate did not apply for an appropriate license and
                    <a
                      href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/the-curious-case-of-storage-devices-and-huawei"

                    in September, 2020, that its drives could be shipped to
                    Huawei without a license, an opinion that
                    <a
                      href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/the-curious-case-of-storage-devices-and-huawei"
                      >was not shared by its rival Western Digital</a
                    >. Since Huawei was not supposed to get HDDs at all,
                    republican senator Roger Wicker

                    >
                    how exactly the sanctioned company obtained such storage
                    devices and whether three global makers of hard drives
                    complied with the export rules.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As it turned out, although Toshiba and Western Digital
                    ceased to sell HDDs to Huawei, Seagate continued to do so.
                    In fact, the company became Huawei's exclusive hard drive
                    supplier and even signed a three-year Strategic Cooperation
                    Agreement and then a Long-Term Agreement to purchase over
                    five million HDDs with the Chinese conglomerate in 2021.

                    [...] The paper's contributing authors include luminaries of
                    the AI world, such as Yoshua Bengio, MILA's scientific
                    director, who is a recipient of a 2019 Turing Award,
                    computing's equivalent of the Nobel Prize. Bengio is widely
                    credited with developing the attention mechanism long before
                    Vaswani and team adapted it for the Transformer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Also among the authors is Stanford University computer
                    science associate professor Christopher RÃ©, who has helped
                    in recent years to advance the notion of AI as

                  <p>
                    To find a sub-quadratic alternative to attention, Poli and
                    team set about studying how the attention mechanism is doing
                    what it does, to see if that work could be done more
                    efficiently.

                    A recent practice in AI science, known as mechanistic
                    interpretability, is yielding insights about what is going
                    on deep inside a neural network, inside the computational
                    "circuits" of attention. You can think of it as taking apart
                    software the way you would take apart a clock or a PC to see
                    its parts and figure out how it operates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One work cited by Poli and team is a set of experiments by
                    researcher Nelson Elhage of AI startup
                    <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>. Those
                    experiments take apart the Transformer programs

                      href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html"

                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In essence, what Elhage and team found is that attention
                    functions at its most basic level by very simple computer
                    operations, such as copying a word from recent input and
                    pasting it into the output.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, if one starts to type into a large language
                    model program such as ChatGPT a sentence from Harry Potter
                    and the Sorcerer's Stone, such as "Mr. Dursley was the
                    director of a firm called Grunnings...", just typing
                    "D-u-r-s", the start of the name, might be enough to prompt
                    the program to complete the name "Dursley" because it has
                    seen the name in a prior sentence of Sorcerer's Stone. The
                    system is able to copy from memory the record of the
                    characters "l-e-y" to autocomplete the sentence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the attention operation runs into the quadratic
                    complexity problem as the amount of words grows and grows.
                    More words require more of what are known as "weights" or
                    parameters, to run the attention operation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As the authors write: "The Transformer block is a powerful
                    tool for sequence modeling, but it is not without its
                    limitations. One of the most notable is the computational
                    cost, which grows rapidly as the length of the input
                    sequence increases."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the technical details of ChatGPT and GPT-4 haven't
                    been disclosed by OpenAI, it is believed they may have a
                    trillion or more such parameters. Running these parameters
                    requires more GPU chips from Nvidia, thus driving up the
                    compute cost.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To reduce that quadratic compute cost, Poli and team replace
                    the attention operation with what's called a "convolution",
                    which is one of the oldest operations in AI programs,
                    refined back in the 1980s. A convolution is just a filter
                    that can pick out items in data, be it the pixels in a
                    digital photo or the words in a sentence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Poli and team do a kind of mash-up: they take work done by
                    Stanford researcher Daniel Y. Fu and team to
                    <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=COZDy0WYGg"
                      >apply convolutional filters to sequences of words</a
                    >, and they combine that with work by scholar David Romero
                    and colleagues at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam that
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08059.pdf"
                      >lets the program change filter size on the fly</a
                    >. That ability to flexibly adapt cuts down on the number of
                    costly parameters, or, weights, the program needs to have.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The result of the mash-up is that a convolution can be
                    applied to an unlimited amount of text without requiring
                    more and more parameters in order to copy more and more
                    data. It's an "attention-free" approach, as the authors put

                    In a post
                    <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/mJUSiXlkKTLH5YHJvpqT6g"

                    on WeChat, Tencent Cloud revealed that "tens of thousands"
                    of its Canghai chips, which are designed to offload video
                    encode/decode for latency sensitive workloads, have been
                    deployed internally to accelerate cloud gaming and live
                    broadcasting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tencent says the Canghai chip can be paired with GPUs from a
                    variety of vendors to support low-latency game streaming.
                    When used for video transcoding, Tencent said a single node
                    equipped with Canghai can deliver up to 1,024 video channels
                    . We'll note that Nvidia, with the launch of its L4 GPUs
                    last month, made similar

                    >. Without real-world benchmarks, it's hard to say how
                    either firm's claims stack up.

                  <p>
                    [...] When it comes to spinning custom chips to improve the
                    efficiency and economics of cloud computing, Amazon Web
                    Services gets a lot of credit. The American e-tail giant and
                    cloud titan has developed everything from custom CPUs, AI
                    training and inference accelerators, and smartNICs to
                    offload many housekeeping workloads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And while Google has developed an accelerator of its own,
                    called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), most US cloud
                    providers have largely stuck with commercially available
                    parts from the likes of Intel, AMD, Ampere, Broadcom, or
                    Nvidia, rather than designing their own.

                    However, in China, custom chips appear to be more prevalent,

                    in mice for the first time. These hair cells are found in
                    the cochlear region of ears in all mammals. They sense sound
                    vibrations, convert those into brain signals, and eventually
                    allow a person to hear and understand the different sounds
                    around them. The new study from URMC researchers sheds light
                    on the underlying mechanism that allowed the ear hairs to
                    regrow in mice."

                    Another former Meta worker who recounted a similar story is
                    35-year-old Britney Levy, who says she joined the company in
                    April 2022 but received her first and only assignment
                    shortly before being laid off in November. Since then,
                    companies across the tech industry, including Amazon, Meta,
                    Microsoft, Twitter, PayPal, Yahoo, Zoom, IBM, Spotify, and
                    others, have announced massive layoffs, affecting tens of
                    thousands of employees.

                    Talking to the WSJ, experts said they believe companies
                    overhired during the pandemic-era boom not because they
                    needed more workers, but to hoard talent from rival
                    companies. According to Vijay Govindarajan, professor at
                    Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, the hiring spree was
                    initially fueled by a shortage of tech talent but eventually
                    became a competition, which led to companies "hiring ahead
                    of demand." He also pointed out that that the situation was
                    very similar to what happened in the finance industry in the
                    early 2000s, when companies overhired during periods of high
                    growth, leaving many workers with not enough work.

                    astronomy is trying to detect radio waves from charged
                    particles trapped by magnetic fieldsâ€”magnetospheresâ€”of
                    planets orbiting other stars. This would help to assess how
                    capable these exoplanets are of hosting life. Radio waves
                    from exoplanet magnetospheres would probably have
                    wavelengths greater than 100m, so they would require a
                    radio-quiet environment in space. Again, the far side of the

                    The Moon also offers opportunities for other types of
                    astronomy as well. Astronomers have lots of experience with
                    optical and infrared telescopes operating in free space,
                    such as the Hubble telescope and JWST. However, the
                    stability of the lunar surface may confer advantages for
                    these types of instrument. Moreover, there are craters at
                    the lunar poles that receive no sunlight. Telescopes that
                    observe the universe at infrared wavelengths are very
                    sensitive to heat and therefore have to operate at low
                    temperatures. JWST, for example, needs a huge sunshield to
                    protect it from the sun's rays. On the Moon, a natural
                    crater rim could provide this shielding for free.

                    and Portugal. "In Canada, which we believe is a reliable
                    predictor for the US, our paid membership base is now larger
                    than prior to the launch of paid sharing and revenue growth

                    This rollout comes after paid sharing tests conducted in
                    Latin America in 2022 were rendered successful. Netflix
                    explains it saw initial cancel reactions in each of the
                    three countries it tested the paid sharing program when the
                    news were announced. But then it saw increased acquisition
                    and revenue as the "borrowers" activated their own paid
                    accounts and existing members began adding extra shared
                    accounts.

                    The European Union finally agreed on a new plan to boost its
                    microchip industry. The multi-billion investment is focused
                    on strengthening Europe's technological leadership, the EU
                    said, but it could very well be an attempt to put the Old
                    Continent on par with what market leaders are already doing
                    right now.

                    After spending some months negotiating between the European
                    Council and the European Parliament, the European Union has
                    now officially approved a plentiful subsidy plan for its
                    semiconductor industry. The

                    will put â‚¬43 billion (roughly $47 billion) to bolster
                    Europe's "competitiveness and resilience" in the microchip
                    business, promoting an effective digital and green

                    Right now, Europe has a 10% market share of global chip
                    manufacturing; with the EU Chips Act, Brussels plans to
                    double the EU's production capacity to 20% of the global
                    market by 2030.

                    >
                    is also focused on strengthening Europe's research and
                    technology capabilities over chip advancements, building
                    innovation capacity in design manufacturing and packaging,
                    developing an in-depth understanding of the global
                    semiconductor supply chain, and addressing the skills
                    shortage by attracting new talents and growing its own
                    skilled workforce.

                    Microchips already are "strategic assets for key industrial
                    value chains," the EU said, while the digital transformation
                    opened new markets for the chip industry such as highly
                    automated cars, cloud, IOT, connectivity, space, defense and
                    supercomputers. The recent global semiconductor shortages
                    also showed how the global supply chain has an "extreme"
                    dependency on very few actors in a complex geopolitical
                    context.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] As a matter of fact, the final EU Chips Act contains
                    some additional provisions which were not included in the
                    initial draft. Besides funding the manufacturing of
                    cutting-edge semiconductor technology, the plan will also
                    cover the entire value chain with older chips and research
                    &amp; design facilities. The EU Chips Act is coming after
                    the world's powerhouses in the chip industry (USA, Taiwan,
                    South Korea, Japan) have already approved or are in the
                    process of approving their own subsidy initiatives.
                    Therefore, Brussels' money to boost EU semiconductor output
                    won't guarantee success.

                Long story short this adds an 2D barcode to product labels
                alongside the existing 1D barcode. The 2D barcode gives extra
                info to the retailer (assuming the manufacturer adds it to the
                barcode) like batch/lot #, expiry date etc and can also provide
                a URL for the product to the consumer where they can find out
                more info about the product. There's even a complete fake brand
                set up to show off the concept -
                <a href="https://dalgiardino.com/">https://dalgiardino.com/</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                Since most POS apps are likely going to be confused by 2
                barcodes on 1 product and potentially double-charge you for your
                favourite box of cornflakes the scanner vendors are implementing
                a feature where they'll only send 1 barcode to the POS system;
                for legacy scanners that'll be the 1D barcode (like now), for
                new scanners that can read 2D barcodes it can either be specific
                GS1 tags or the entire barcode depending on what the POS
                application wants.
              </p>

                Note that this is already live for some manufacturers and

                    The relevance of a quiet aircraft to the DOD is likely
                    obvious. Whisper has validated that it can fly a 55-pound
                    drone with its electric-ducted fan at an altitude of 200
                    feet that is completely undetectable, at least by noise,
                    from the ground. To put that in context, Moore said Boeing's
                    popular military drone, the Insitu ScanEagle, would need to
                    fly at least 3,000 feet above to not be heard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's sort of a breakthrough in terms of what surveillance
                    drones are capable of doing in terms of missions, by being
                    able to get so close and not be detected," Moore said.
                    "Especially at night, where you won't be able to see it. It
                    can be flying and loitering right overhead and you would
                    have no idea that's there."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The company is quick to point out that the benefits
                    don't just lie in decreased noise, but also in the
                    efficiency gains â€“ a metric that's all the more important as
                    more of the world's technologies switch to electric, and
                    must depend on the limited lifespan of batteries. The
                    company also says that many aircraft have speeds that are
                    limited by open rotors (or open propellors), as opposed to
                    ducted. Instead of operating at 150 miles per hour, an eVTOL
                    could potentially fly as fast as 300-400 miles per hour.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We are this future Pratt &amp; Whitney mashed up with
                    a Dyson," Moore said, referring to the giant aircraft engine
                    maker and the consumer tech company best known for its
                    vacuums and hair dryers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We're very anxious to take this technology to people's
                    everyday life."

                    Camp says the discovery was a far cry from the malware he
                    typically studies, and a lot less work for an attacker who
                    happened upon one of these unwiped routers. "I don't need a
                    zero day, I have your router," quips Camp.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Meanwhile, one of the unwiped routers contained what
                    Camp describes as a "creepy" remote administration
                    interface.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I was never sure if it was on purpose, but it was creepy,
                    very low-level access, and from one of the countries with
                    flags that we're [the US] not happy with right now," he
                    says. "It could be totally legit or that could be really
                    bad. It was a little edgy to me."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] So how do you wipe a router that you want to retire?
                    The good news is most routers are fairly easy to securely
                    decommission, and the big three Cisco, Fortinet, and Juniper
                    on their websites provide detailed guidelines for restoring
                    devices to their factory default settings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] And if your organization already had disposed of
                    routers that weren't properly wiped, Eset recommends
                    rotating cryptographic keys in case an attacker were to get
                    their hands on your old router and attempt to gain trusted
                    access to your network. Zero trust can help here as well,
                    they say.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] If you buy a secondhand core router, and like the
                    researchers find that it still contains the previous owner's
                    information, Eset recommends disconnecting the router and
                    moving it to a secured area and contact your regional CISA
                    office. They also say it's best to document your purchase
                    process as a precaution for insurance or legal purposes.
