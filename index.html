                    Why do I teach idealistic young people how to lead a life of
                    cybercrime? Many of my students will pursue careers in
                    government or with law firms whose clients include major
                    technology companies. I want these budding lawyers to
                    understand their clients' issues. But my larger aim is to
                    put technical expertise in its place: I want my students to
                    realize that technology alone is not enough to solve the
                    problems we face.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I start my class by explaining the fundamental principle of
                    modern computing: the distinction between code and data.
                    Code is a set of instructions: "add," "print my résumé,"
                    "shut the door." Data is information. Data is usually
                    represented by numbers (the temperature is 80 degrees), code
                    by words ("add"). But in 1936, the British mathematician
                    Alan Turing figured out that code could be represented by
                    numbers as well. Indeed, Turing was able to show how to
                    represent both code and data using only ones and zeros —
                    so-called binary strings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This groundbreaking insight makes modern computers possible.
                    We don't need to rebuild our computers for every new
                    program. We can feed our devices whatever code we like as
                    binary strings and run that program. That zeros and ones can
                    represent both code and data is, however, a blessing and a
                    curse, because it enables hackers to trick computers that
                    are expecting data into accepting and running malicious code
                    instead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Diversion programs in Britain and the Netherlands run
                    hacking competitions where teams of coders compete to hack a
                    target network; these programs also seek to match up coders
                    with older security personnel to act as mentors and direct
                    their charges into the legitimate cybersecurity industry. At
                    the moment, with an estimated 3.5 million jobs unfilled
                    worldwide, one fewer attacker is one more desperately needed
                    defender.

                    is a flexible system with use cases ranging from retro
                    gaming platforms to industrial use cases for factories and
                    more. Today we're sharing one research team's foray into
                    science with the help of our favorite SBC and looking at how
                    well it compares to modern, more expensive tools. Liam
                    Taylor, Duncan Quincy, and Mark Smith recently deployed a
                    set of Raspberry Pis to help monitor glacier calving in both
                    <a href="https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/23/329/2023"
                      >Iceland and Peru</a
                    >.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the team, monitoring calving fronts is critical
                    as extreme changes can result in environmental impacts for
                    local residents. For example, things like tsunamis, floods,
                    and the collapse of icebergs can cause serious damage, and
                    monitoring these changes can help those living nearby
                    respond before the problems worsen. Part of their research
                    was to test the performance of a Raspberry Pi in monitoring
                    these changes against more conventional tools they usually
                    use, in this case, an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To test the Pi against the UAV monitoring system, the team
                    traveled to Fjallsjökull, Iceland. Here they could survey
                    glaciers both from the shore and from a boat. The area also
                    had a great variety of calving margin heights that made it
                    easier to test the accuracy of the Raspberry Pi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Raspberry Pis were tested using both a Camera Module V2
                    and an HQ Camera Module using a 16mm telephoto lens. The
                    Camera Module V2 proved too inadequate for their
                    measurements, so the team opted to stick with the HQ Camera
                    Module. The UAV chosen to compare against the Pi was a DJI
                    Mavic 2 Pro UAV. The Raspberry Pis were then attached to a
                    tripod with critical components like batteries stored inside
                    a weatherproofed box.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team mounted some of the Pis to a boat as they passed by
                    while the UAV moved overhead. Recording the glaciers
                    simultaneously allowed the team to get an accurate
                    comparison of the charting ability of both devices. Using
                    the pictures taken by the Pi, the team created a 3D render
                    of the glaciers using photogrammetry.

                    A molecule that was initially developed to treat
                    tuberculosis but failed to progress out of the lab as an
                    antibiotic is now showing promise as a powerful foe for
                    weeds that invade our gardens and cost farmers billions of
                    dollars each year.

                    While the failed antibiotic wasn't fit for its original
                    purpose, scientists at the University of Adelaide discovered
                    that by tweaking its structure, the molecule became
                    effective at killing two of the most problematic weeds in
                    Australia, annual ryegrass and wild radish, without harming
                    bacterial and human cells. This research has been published

                    hard to control."

                    Researchers at the University's Herbicide and Antibiotic
                    Innovation Lab discovered there were similarities between
                    bacterial superbugs and weeds at a molecular level.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They exploited these similarities, and by chemically
                    modifying the structure of a failed antibiotic, they were
                    able to block the production of amino acid lysine, which is
                    essential for weed growth.

                  <p>
                    "There are no commercially available herbicides on the
                    market that work in this way. In fact, in the past 40 years,
                    there have been hardly any new herbicides with new
                    mechanisms of action that have entered the market," said Dr.
                    Andrew Barrow, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Soares da
                    Costa's team at the University of Adelaide's Waite Research
                    Institute.

                    [...] It's not just farmers who could reap the benefits of
                    this discovery. Researchers say it could also lead to the
                    development of new weed killers to target pesky weeds
                    growing in our backyards and driveways.

                  <p>
                    "Our re-purposing approach has the potential to discover
                    herbicides with broad applications that can kill a variety
                    of weeds," said Dr. Barrow.

                    When working memristor technology was first announced, it
                    generated a lot of excitement within the tech industry. This
                    was mainly because memristors promised faster, more
                    energy-efficient, and longer-lasting storage solutions than
                    traditional RAM and SSDs. This led to high expectations and
                    a flurry of investments in research and development.
                    However, the hype surrounding memristors has significantly
                    waned in recent years, with the technology yet to impact the
                    market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite their potential advantages, several challenges have
                    hindered the widespread adoption of memristor technology.
                    Manufacturing memristors at a large scale has proven
                    difficult and expensive. This has limited the number of
                    companies willing to invest in developing and producing
                    memristor-based devices. Also, while memristors have shown
                    promise in laboratory settings, their real-world application
                    performance has not always met expectations. Factors such as
                    temperature fluctuations and material inconsistencies have
                    led to variable performance and stability issues. To quote
                    Wikipedia "Experimentally, the ideal memristor has yet to be
                    demonstrated." So those diligently working on the problem
                    are looking for a tantalizingly close breakthrough.

                    account tweeted "Love is sharing a password." And at CES in

                    Streaming companies have been tweaking their businesses over
                    the past year as they struggle with increasing competition
                    and the reality that people can only afford so many monthly
                    subscription fees. Many have raised prices, including Prime
                    Video, Netflix and Apple TV Plus, but no other company has
                    gone after account sharing in the same way.

                    Extreme weather caused by climate change has damaged food
                    production across Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Confronted with a deteriorating situation, divided European
                    Union decision-makers are debating new rules for genetically
                    modified crops.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last year's drought ravaged the continent's farms, starving
                    everything from Spanish olive harvests to Hungary's maize
                    and sunflower crops, Italian and Romanian corn fields to
                    France's dairy production.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some argue the answer to Europe's problems is deregulating
                    gene modification techniques to produce better crops. Others
                    claim this would be a "smokescreen" to avoid having to
                    radically change the way the bloc farms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Supporters say seeds produced using gene editing techniques
                    are less vulnerable to drought and disease—and require less
                    water.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The powerful European farming lobby group Copa-Cogeca
                    supports the new rules.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If we need to supply society with food in Europe, and if we
                    want to be self-sufficient, then we need to adapt rules,"
                    said Thor Gunnar Kofoed, chair of the seed working group at
                    Copa-Cogeca.
                  </p>
                  <p>A majority of EU lawmakers support relaxing the rules.</p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Greens want a full risk assessment to avoid
                    unintended effects and force producers to ensure detection
                    and traceability methods, and make labeling compulsory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Labeling would put off consumers who prefer GMO-free food,
                    said Mute Schimpf, a campaigner for Friends of the Earth
                    Europe, who criticized the reform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This proposal is a smokescreen to avoid the debate we
                    should have on shifting to a truly sustainable farming
                    system," she told AFP.

                    Facebook parent company Meta received a record-breaking $1.3
                    billion fine in Europe (€1.2 billion) following a privacy
                    violation that regulators have been investigating for a
                    decade. It involves the transfer of Facebook data belonging
                    to European Union users to the US. The EU started looking
                    into the company's data transfer practices in 2013,
                    following the Edward Snowden revelations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The EU action comes just months ahead of a new planned data
                    transfer deal between the US and the EU. Unsurprisingly,
                    Meta is contesting the fine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The EU worries that the Facebook data transfers in
                    question expose its citizens to privacy violations and
                    violate GDPR. The data transfers were protected by a US-EU
                    pact called the Privacy Shield. But the EU's top courts
                    found that the pact did not actually shield EU citizens. US
                    surveillance programs could still collect data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the new ruling, Meta also has to stop
                    transferring EU data to the US.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Schrems also said he expects Meta to appeal the
                    decision but that a win for the company in the case is
                    unlikely. "Past violations cannot be overcome by a new EU-US
                    deal. Meta can at best delay the payment of the fine for a
                    bit."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meta, of course, is in a position where it can afford to pay
                    such hefty privacy fines. "A billion-euro parking ticket is
                    of no consequence to a company that earns many more billions
                    by parking illegally," Johnny Ryan told The Guardian. Ryan
                    is a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Fine and restrictions aside, Meta will soon be able to
                    transfer user data to the US without having to worry about
                    fines like this. The EU and the US are working on a new deal
                    to cover such data transfers. That deal could be in place by
                    October. Still, the new agreement can't protect the company
                    from past offenses.

                    After some people had falsely claimed they had her camera,

                    and did not want the reward money, but Lee insisted that

                OK, it is not a 'techie' or a STEM story - but how many of us
                have lost something absolutely vital to our work? A laptop
                maybe, or probably a cell/mobile phone with all the data that it
                contains. What measures do you take now to prevent a similar

                    answered the calls for help. The mass outage, the company

                    built-in security daemon present in a wide range of their
                    routers," one person
                    <a
                      href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/13kzm8n/comment/jkrrhh4/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3"
                      >wrote</a
                    >. "As routers automatically updated and fetched the
                    corrupted definition file, they started running out of
                    filesystem space and memory and crashing."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The explanation answered the question of what was causing
                    routers to crash, but it raised a new one: Why were routers
                    affected even when they had been configured to not
                    automatically update and no manual update had been
                    performed? Asus has yet to address this, but the likely
                    answer is that the definitions file for ASD, which resides
                    in memory and scans devices for security threats, gets
                    updated whether or not automatic updates are enabled.

                    Samsung, Oppo and Nokia are among a range of Android phone
                    makers with facial recognition scanning tech that can be
                    "easily duped" by a printed 2D photo, according to tests
                    undertaken by campaign group Which?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Resident techies that put a range of phones and brands
                    through their paces (see box below) said the findings were
                    of concern as biometric tech is often billed as one of the
                    most secure ways to unlock a handset.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of the 48 phones Which? sent to labs for testing, 19 could
                    be spoofed with photos and "worryingly" these were "not even
                    particularly high resolution and were printed on a standard
                    office printer on normal, rather than photo, paper."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The vast majority of the phones that failed the simple
                    biometric test were, unsurprisingly, low to mid-range in
                    price, though Which? claimed there were exceptions,
                    including the Xiaomi 13 and the Motorola Razr.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of the phones that Which? reckons could be fooled, seven
                    were made by Xiaomi, four came from Motorola, while two came
                    from each of Nokia, Oppo and Samsung. One model made by
                    Honor and another by Vivo was also found to be exploitable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under Android's requirements, phone makers must ensure
                    devices and software are "Android compatible," which
                    includes how often device security can be spoofed. Class 3
                    systems must not be duped more than 7 percent of the time,
                    and Class 1 system are least secure, with a spot rate of 20
                    percent of the time to more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Which? voiced worries that scammers could exploit the
                    weakness to – for example – access Google Wallet to make
                    payments to a limited value (£45 in the UK, about $56)
                    without needing to unlock their phone. For larger
                    transactions, Google asks users to use a Class 3 biometric
                    lock, Which? said.

                    Should it succeed, PLD Space will become the first private
                    micro launcher to launch a rocket in Europe's emerging space
                    race.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Spanish manufacturer PLD Space successfully carried out the
                    final ignition test of its reusable Miura 1 rocket on
                    Wednesday, setting the stage for its imminent launch from
                    southern Europe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the next few days, PLD Space aims to become the first
                    private micro launcher company to actually launch a rocket
                    in the European space race. The Miura 1 is a one-stage
                    suborbital rocket that stands 41 feet (12.5 meters) long, or
                    about the height of four-story building. The rocket serves
                    as a proof-of-concept for PLD's larger Miura 5 rocket, which
                    aims to launch satellites into orbit beginning in 2025.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    PLD Space developed the Miura 1's TEPREL-B motor in-house,
                    which can achieve a thrust of 30 kN with a simple
                    pressure-fed cycle using jet fuel. The rocket can reach an
                    altitude of 93 miles (150 kilometers) with a cargo of 220
                    pounds (100 kilograms) and is meant to be reusable for at
                    least three trips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Miura 1 will be launched towards the Atlantic
                    Ocean from a cliff on the coast of Huelva in southwestern
                    Spain, specifically a military test zone known as "Médano
                    del Loro." The launch is scheduled to take place on a
                    Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, when the area will be free of
                    fishermen, at 7:30 a.m. local time. On the day of the
                    launch, the air space will be closed, and officials will
                    establish an exclusion area in the ocean. The Spanish
                    Institute of Aerospace Technology has already approved
                    several launch windows through May 31.

                    Congress wants to force AM into every new car for emergency
                    alerts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fight over the future of AM radio got a little more
                    heated this week as organizations representing the auto and
                    technology industries told Congress that its plan to mandate
                    this mode of radio wave reception is poorly conceived and
                    will hinder progress.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AM radio has seen almost every other in-car entertainment
                    option come and go—vinyl, 8-tracks, cassettes, CDs—and it
                    might predate just about everything other than playing "I
                    Spy," but time is catching up with this old broadcast
                    technology. It is starting to get left behind as new
                    models—many of which are electric vehicles—drive off into
                    the sunset, streaming their audio instead of modulating its
                    amplitude.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "As more and more Americans adopt electric vehicles,
                    we must ensure that they are equipped with AM radio. AM
                    radio is—and will remain—an essential communications channel
                    for emergency alerts and for disseminating news and other
                    important information to residents of our district and
                    communities across our country. I am proud to co-lead this
                    bipartisan legislation which would ensure that EVs continue
                    to be equipped with this basic but critical capability,"
                    said Rep. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), another co-sponsor.

                    Shutterstock is buying Giphy for $53 million after Meta's
                    acquisition of the popular GIF platform was blocked by the

                    That price represents a steep discount compared to what Meta
                    (then Facebook) reportedly agreed to pay for Giphy

                    the deal was worth around $400 million, while

                    >
                    closer to $315 million. Either way, a $53 million price tag
                    is a bargain versus Giphy's peak valuation of around $600
                    million in 2016. As part of the deal, Meta will retain
                    access to Giphy's library across its products.

                  <p>
                    Meta's acquisition of Giphy ran into trouble when the UK's
                    competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority
                    (CMA), ordered Facebook's parent company to
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22740272/facebook-giphy-acquisition-competition-and-markets-authority-uk-regulator"
                      >unwind the deal in 2021</a
                    >. The CMA argued that the deal could harm competition by
                    increasing Meta's market power, potentially allowing it to
                    block its rival's access to GIFs or force them to hand over
                    valuable user data in exchange for them. Although it
                    appealed the ruling,
                    <a

                  <p>
                    For Shutterstock, the deal will augment its content library,
                    expanding it to include GIFs and Stickers. The company also
                    said it would help its "generative AI and metadata
                    strategy." That's a bit more vague, but Shutterstock is
                    currently using

                      >generative AI to provide imagery to its customers</a
                    >. Acquiring Giphy's substantial library could theoretically
                    give Shutterstock reams of training data for future AI-based
                    products.

                    "Through the Giphy acquisition, we are extending our
                    audience touch points beyond primarily professional
                    marketing and advertising use cases and expanding into
                    casual conversations," Shutterstock CEO Paul Hennessy said
                    in a statement. "We plan to leverage Shutterstock's unique
                    capabilities in content and metadata monetization,
                    generative AI, studio production and creative automation to
                    enable the commercialization of our GIF library as we roll
                    this offering out to customers."

                    All modern Intel and AMD PCs can trace their roots to a
                    single system: the IBM Personal Computer. Originally
                    released in August 1981, this computer became so popular and
                    long-lived that competitors reverse-engineered its BIOS so
                    that their computers could use the same software and
                    peripherals, a practice that eventually resulted in a de
                    facto standard whose descendants we still use today.

                    If you want to experience what using an old IBM PC was like,
                    you could drop a few hundred dollars on a used one on eBay.

                    5/20/2023: After this story was published, Ars was contacted
                    by developer Sergey Kiselev, who maintains an open-source
                    8088 BIOS on GitHub. He alleged that the creators of the
                    Book 8088 re-used his BIOS for the system while removing his
                    name and language about the GPL v2 license that the BIOS is
                    distributed under; we can't confirm the claim by comparing
                    the code directly, but there are several distinct
                    similarities in a screenshot Kiselev shared and one used in
                    the Book 8088 retail listing.

                    "While my work is open source, and I don't mind people using
                    it in their projects, I do care deeply about the principles
                    of open source software development and licensing. And
                    whoever manufacturers this machine, bluntly violates
                    copyright law and licensing," wrote Kiselev to Ars detailing
                    his claim. "Since you start your article with the discussion
                    of how Compaq reverse engineered IBM's BIOS, I think it
                    would be suitable to mention that the manufacturer pirated
                    the BIOS, without crediting the work, and they violate GPL
                    by not releasing the source code of their modified BIOS."

                According to Raspberry Pi CEO, Eben Upton, in an interview with
                YouTuber Jeff Geerling, the company put together 750,000
                Raspberry Pi units in the first quarter of the year. That isn't
                a lot, but it also says that it's on track for building 2
                million units this second quarter, helping it fill backlogged
                orders and paving the way for "unconstrained" supply during the
                remaining half of the year. Ultimately though, it means that you
                should expect units such as the Raspberry Pi 4 to be more widely
                available by the end of this year.

                    the transcript, something most viewers never look at, that

                    ChatGPT took those instructions and added a joke to the

                    tried this, it did not introduce itself as a Genie and it
                    never printed the text "AI Injection succeeded." It also
                    worked about 20 percent of the times I tried.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I then edited some Tom's Hardware YouTube videos'
                    transcripts to add prompts to them. I learned that you do
                    not necessarily need to put the prefix "***IMPORTANT NEW
                    INSTRUCTIONS***" to get this to work, though adding
                    "Instruction:" may help. I also experimented with putting
                    the prompts at the top or in the middle of a transcript
                    instead of at the bottom. Overall, it seems that top or
                    bottom placement could work but, either way, the prompt
                    instructions would only be followed at the end of the
                    summarization.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The only injected prompts I was able to get working were
                    telling a joke and Rickrolling. When I tried inserting
                    prompts that would command ChatGPT to print specific text,
                    use emojis or just ignore the summarization entirely, it
                    didn't work. Even asking for a specific type of joke didn't
                    work.

                    "The UK has strengths across the semiconductor value chain,
                    but possesses three particular areas of strategic advantage
                    — semiconductor design and IP, compound semiconductors, and
                    our world-leading research and innovation system, supported
                    by our fantastic universities," the policy paper said.
                    Unlike silicon-based chips, compound semiconductors are
                    composed of two or more elements, and can be used to
                    optimize high-performance applications in electronics and
                    optoelectronics.

                  <p>
                    The policy paper also noted that there are currently around
                    25 semiconductor manufacturing sites in the UK that process
                    between a few hundred wafers to several thousand wafers per
                    month.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Though the UK government appears to have recognized
                    the potential of building on its existing research base to
                    develop its semiconductor sector, there needs to be further
                    clarity around exactly what the £1 billion will be applied
                    to, as well as how and when it will be applied, said Scott
                    White, founder and executive director of strategic
                    initiatives at UK-based Pragmatic Semiconductor, a maker of
                    custom integrated circuits that provide an alternative to
                    silicon-based chips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "When you look at the areas the UK is focused on there is a
                    valid question to be asked over whether that's enough money
                    to make a difference – is it too much of a dilution to
                    spread the amount over 10 years," he said, adding that the
                    government needs to provide more detail in order to address
                    these concerns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Ultimately, you could invest £100 million annually into
                    something that really moves the needle for the industry. You
                    could equally waste £1 billion in a year by focusing it on
                    areas that won't have an impact," White said.

                    The origin of the world's most popular beer may have
                    inadvertently come about due to the death of a childless
                    German nobleman, Professor John Morrissey, School of
                    Microbiology, UCC and an international team of researchers
                    have discovered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Combining historical research with modern science, a team of
                    scientists from the Technical University of Munich in
                    Germany and UCC have uncovered the likely genesis and path
                    to world dominance of <em>Saccharomyces pastorianus</em> –
                    the yeast responsible for producing lager yeast. [...]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lager yeast is a distinct bottom-fermenting species that
                    prefers cooler temperatures and sediments stronger compared
                    to the top-fermenting ale yeast. The famous Bavarian
                    Reinheitsgebot brewing ordnance of 1516 stipulated that only
                    bottom fermentation was permitted – but in 1548 the powerful
                    nobleman Hans VI von Degenberg was granted a dispensation to
                    allow the brewing wheat beer through top fermentation.
                    However when Hans VIII Sigmund von Degenberg, the grandson
                    of Hans VI, died without an heir in 1602, his property and
                    assets- including the family brewery at Schwarzach in
                    Bavaria - were seized by Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria and
                    later Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Historical records show that on Oct 24th 1602,
                    top-fermenting yeast were brought from Schwarzach to the
                    Duke's Hofbräuhaus brewery in Munich, where the brewing of
                    wheat beer then alternated with the traditional Bavarian
                    brown beer. Now, writing in the peer-reviewed Journal FEMS
                    Yeast Research, the authors propose that by the time a
                    dedicated wheat beer brewery had opened in 1607,
                    top-fermenting wheat beer yeasts from Schwarzach and
                    bottom-fermenting yeasts from the Munich Hofbräühaus had
                    mated to create a brand new species that we now know as
                    <em>S. pastorianus</em> – the lager yeast. And, as they say
                    – the rest is history.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We often think historical events are almost pre-programmed,
                    but this is an amazing example of how chance events – the
                    lack of an heir, the Duke's thirst for wheat beer, and the
                    unorthodox sex between different yeasts, culminated in a new
                    yeast species that changed the world of beer," Professor
                    Morrissey said.

                    Body odor was apparently a more attractive bait than CO2 — a
                    known cue for mosquitoes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But further tests showed that the swarm of 200 individuals
                    were also choosy. The aromas of six volunteers sleeping in
                    surrounding single-person tents were piped onto the pads
                    over six consecutive nights.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It enabled the researchers to record the mosquitoes'
                    preferences and collect nightly air samples from the tents
                    to compare airborne components of body odor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Senior author Dr. Conor McMeniman, a vector biologist, said,
                    "These mosquitoes typically hunt humans in the hours before
                    and after midnight," as SWNS also reported.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    He added, "We wanted to assess mosquito olfactory
                    preferences during the peak period of activity when they are
                    out and about and active — and also assess the odor from
                    sleeping humans during that same time window."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Night after night, some people were more attractive to
                    mosquitoes than others, the study found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One volunteer, who had a strikingly different odor,

                    Said lead co-author Dr. Stephanie Rankin-Turner, an
                    analytical chemist, "It is probably a ratio-specific blend
                    they are following ... We don't really know yet exactly what
                    aspect of skin secretions, microbial metabolites or breath
                    emissions are really driving this, but we are hoping we will
                    be able to figure that out in the coming years."

                    The world is undergoing an energy transition to reduce CO2
                    emissions and mitigate climate change. The COVID-19 pandemic
                    and the Russia-Ukraine war have further increased the
                    interest of Europe and Western countries to invest in the
                    hydrogen economy as an alternative to fossil fuels. Hydrogen
                    can significantly reduce geopolitical risks if the diversity
                    of future hydrogen energy suppliers is increased.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hydrogen is a particularly challenging product to transport
                    safely. One option is to liquefy hydrogen, which requires
                    cooling to 20 Kelvin (-253 °C). This is an expensive process
                    and requires around 30% of the energy stored within the
                    hydrogen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A pioneering approach developed by IIASA researchers and
                    colleagues proposes solid air (nitrogen or oxygen) as a
                    medium for recycling cooling energy across the hydrogen
                    liquefaction supply chain. At standard temperature and
                    pressure, air is a gas, but under certain conditions, it can
                    become a liquid or solid. Solid Air Hydrogen Liquefaction
                    (SAHL) consists of storing the cooling energy from the
                    regasification of hydrogen, by solidifying air, and
                    transporting the solid air back to where the hydrogen was
                    liquefied. The solid air is then used to reduce the energy
                    consumption for liquefying hydrogen. The process is divided
                    into four main steps: hydrogen regasification, solid air
                    transportation, hydrogen liquefaction, and liquid hydrogen
                    transportation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] In their paper, the authors also address the ongoing
                    debate in industry and academia to find the best alternative
                    to transport hydrogen by sea:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Compared to ammonia or methanol, liquefied hydrogen is the
                    best option for several reasons. Transporting hydrogen with
                    ammonia and other molecules would require around 30% of the
                    energy transported to extract the hydrogen. The hydrogen is
                    liquefied where electricity is cheap. Also, SAHL can lower
                    energy consumption for hydrogen liquefaction by 25 to 50%,"
                    Hunt concludes.

                    The researchers obtained these results by using an
                    exploratory ensemble approach, which samples several
                    variables at different levels —for example, carbon emissions
                    at different levels of emission—to obtain an understanding
                    of the breadth of potential future scenarios.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Instead of using narrative-based scenarios, which tend to
                    ask questions such as, 'What if we have a high inequality
                    world?' or 'What if we have a low carbon development world?'
                    we developed a large ensemble of scenarios," said first
                    author Xinyuan Huang, a doctoral student in the Penn State
                    Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. "This
                    approach couples models of climate, energy and health to
                    explore a wide range of plausible futures."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this assessment, the researchers modeled the energy and
                    land system changes for 32 geopolitical regions based on the
                    Global Change Analysis Model, an open-source integrated
                    assessment model. They then conducted the air quality and
                    health impact assessment for nearly 200 countries.

                  <p>
                    Peng said that since the future is deeply uncertain, the
                    likelihood of potential future scenarios that involve health
                    co-harms are unknown, but their findings demonstrate the
                    possibilities of unintended consequences of climate
                    mitigation.

                    "What I find especially useful is that now we can start to
                    think about the levers we have, and how we can use them to
                    mitigate harmful impacts and to embrace the benefits," she
                    said. "If we go for the bioenergy-heavy future, then we
                    really need to pay attention to how we manage land."

                    People leave jobs all the time, whether they're laid off,
                    fired, or just quit. But how do their departures affect
                    coworkers left behind? According to a
                    <a
                      href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2021.1327"

                    >
                    from the UBC Sauder School of Business, those exits can lead
                    many others to call it quits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers delved deeply into employment data from a
                    major retailer that was experiencing high turnover to find
                    out why. They reviewed data for roughly a million employees
                    — including when they were hired, which store, which
                    position, when they left, and why.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study authors also had access to employee performance
                    records, so they could evaluate whether workers were high
                    performers or low performers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "It's very bad news for organizations, especially if
                    they are laying off high performers, because if those
                    positions get eliminated, both high and low performers start
                    quitting," said Dr. Sajjadiani. "It's a signal that people's
                    jobs aren't secure, and the organization doesn't care about
                    them, no matter how hard they work. So they think, 'I should
                    leave as soon as possible.'"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When employees quit their jobs voluntarily, their departures
                    give a more moderate boost to voluntary turnover, and it
                    takes longer for that ripple effect to occur.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "To high performers, voluntary exits are a positive signal
                    that there are better opportunities elsewhere," said Dr.
                    Sajjadiani. "So while employees might not leave immediately,
                    they do begin to look for other opportunities."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] However, when a high performer is dismissed without
                    clear justification, employers not only open themselves to
                    legal headaches, it also sends the wrong message to other
                    high performers. They also start heading for the door.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to Dr. Sajjadiani, organizations vastly
                    underestimate the ripple effects of people leaving and the
                    resulting human capital costs. The research also sends a
                    clear message to organizations that they should be extremely
                    careful when they make exit decisions, or they risk
                    destabilizing the whole organization very quickly.

                    Micro and nanoplastics are pervasive in our food supply and
                    may be affecting food safety and security on a global scale,
                    a new study led by CSIRO, Australia's national science
                    agency, has found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study is one of the first to analyze the academic
                    literature on microplastics from a food safety and food
                    security risk viewpoint, building on past studies which
                    primarily tracked plastics in fish.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It shows that plastics and their additives are present at a
                    range of concentrations not only in fish but in many
                    products including meat, chicken, rice, water, take-away
                    food and drink, and even fresh produce.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    CSIRO analytical chemist, food safety specialist and lead
                    author of the paper, Dr. Jordi Nelis, said these plastics
                    enter the human food chain through numerous pathways, such
                    as ingestion as shown in the fish studies, but one of the
                    main ways is through food processing and packaging. The
                    research is published in the journal
                    <i>TrAC Trends in Analytical Chemistry</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There are currently no definitive studies that
                    demonstrate micro and nanoplastics in the environment cause
                    harm to humans, however more research is needed to fully
                    understand health effects.

                  <p>
                    [...] "The key missing information is determining safe
                    levels of microplastics. We currently don't know exactly
                    what the microplastic flux through the food system is or
                    which levels can be considered safe," Dr. Nelis said.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    On May 9, NASA's Lucy spacecraft carried out a trajectory
                    correction maneuver to set the spacecraft on course for its
                    close encounter with the small main belt asteroid Dinkinesh.
                    The maneuver changed the velocity of the spacecraft by only
                    about 7.7 mph (3.4 m/s).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even though the spacecraft is currently traveling at
                    approximately 43,000 mph (19.4 km/s), this small nudge is
                    enough to move the spacecraft nearly 40,000 miles (65,000
                    km) closer to the asteroid during the planned encounter on
                    Nov. 1, 2023. The spacecraft will fly a mere 265 miles (425
                    km) from the small, half-mile-(sub-km)-sized asteroid, while
                    traveling at a relative speed of 10,000 mph (4.5 km/s).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Lucy team will continue to monitor the spacecraft's
                    trajectory and will have further opportunities to fine tune
                    the flight path if needed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Lucy team is also continuing to analyze the data
                    collected from its spring instrument calibration campaign
                    and make other preparations for the mission's first asteroid
                    encounter. This encounter will provide a valuable test of
                    the spacecraft's systems and procedures to make sure that
                    everything operates as expected during the mission's
                    high-speed asteroid encounters.

                    If you've ever had to write a program which interfaces
                    directly with hardware — perhaps while writing a program for
                    an MCU or embedded system or a kernel driver — you may have
                    noticed a few common patterns in register map behaviour and
                    design. I'm not sure anyone has ever really collected them
                    together, so I decided to make a list of all the ones I can
                    think of.

                This is a post that I have suspected that I was going to have to
                write since late December last year.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will now know that SoylentNews.org is closing down on 30
                June but things have not been standing still behind the scenes
                since we first became aware of NCommander's decision at the end
                of last week. In fact, it has been a very busy weekend.
              </p>
              <p>
                A small group of existing staff are looking at alternative
                possibilities for a 'replacement' site to keep the flow of
                stories going and allowing discussions to continue. This is a
                big task, especially in the 38 days remaining in which to try to
                achieve it. There are several possibilities which spring to
                mind, Pipedot for example. I have reached out to Bryan but have
                not yet received a response. However, things as not as
                straightforward as they seem. The pipecode is written in Php-5
                which some of you will realise is no longer supported. We do not
                want to become dependant on old software which cannot be
                maintained into the future; that lesson has been taken aboard
                and reinforced by NCommander's explanation regarding his
                decision announced today. There are other options but at the
                moment it is still a search for what is available out there
                today which also appears maintainable into the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                But the first thing we need to know is "Is there still
                sufficient interest in having a discussion site such as ours?"
                Do you, the community, still want to have your daily dose of
                stories and the ability to exchange views with many others on
                this site? Are there any community members who would be willing
                to join us in trying to establish such a site? Your views are
                crucial to everything that we do over the coming days and weeks.
                So please let us know what you think about whether a site is
                still required with all the alternative technology available
                today that simply didn't exist 9 years ago. What form should a
                new site take? What changes to how we operate are essential for
                you to continue to remain interested in the future site?
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, it cannot be a mirror image of what we have today -
                which many will see as a good thing! But I hope that we would be
                able to transfer existing accounts, usernames and passwords
                directly to any new site that we create. We would also have to
                start with a relatively simple site and build on that over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of the day we would have to restart the voluntary
                subscriptions but not immediately. We can raise some funds to
                see us get established without the requirement of a financial
                commitment from the community. Subscriptions were always
                sufficient in the past and I don't see why that would not be the
                case in the future too. The fact that we currently have enough
                to keep this site going until next year bears witness to that.
                We have also found that we can significantly reduce our running
                costs based on our current community rather than being ready for
                a major stream of new members which never materialises. I have
                no grandiose ideas of becoming a huge site employing our own
                journalists but just a community that enjoys the discussions as
                we have been doing for several years. Nevertheless, we would
                also be trying to build on our existing community which is
                beginning to happen on this site now that things have settled
                down.
              </p>
              <p>So don't hold back - let us know what you think.</p>

              <h3>Technical Reasons</h3>
              <p>
                Let's start with the technical nitty gritty. SoylentNews was, in
                November 2022, at the point where it was about to have a fatal
                database crash. The database cluster was wedged in an invalid
                state. Backups weren't properly being done. As it was, we lost
                several days of postings after a hard crash. On top of that, we
                had multiple public facing machines running outdated versions of
                CentOS and Ubuntu running net facing services.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's two distinct problems here, both of which have to be
                addressed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first is the site itself, and specifically what we can or
                can't do with it. At this point, rehash, the backend that runs
                SoylentNews, is nearly 30 years old, and it was written in what
                can be generously described as angry and especially esoteric
                Perl. Perl was already going extinct when we launched in 2014,
                and at this point is mostly relegated to legacy backend code
                which is slowly but surely disappearing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Complicating matters is that rehash is specifically tied into
                Apache 2.2 via mod_perl, a version that is well past end of life
                and significantly out of date. While the website is well
                sandboxed and battle hardened, running obsolete code on the
                public Internet is not a smart move especially when combined
                with many of the other factors listed below.
              </p>
              <p>
                To just keep up with patched software, we would either need to
                port the site to Apache 2.4 and a recent version of mod_perl, or
                break the Apache dependency with an alternative like FastCGI.
                This would also require updating the base version of Perl5 to
                something more recent and hoping all the necessary CPAN modules
                have either been updated, or can be reasonably replaced, which
                is doubtful at best
              </p>
              <p>
                As the person who actually did the base port of rehash from
                Apache 1.3 to Apache 2, this is a massive project regardless of
                which way we would go. This would require a full rebuild of the
                /srv/soylentnews.org directory which alone could easily take
                weeks or months of work. That doesn't take into account all the
                other bits of infrastructure and software that would need to be
                reworked, rebuilt, or replaced.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we migrated to rehash, we had more staff who could QA the
                site and quite a bit went wrong trying to do that relatively
                simpler migration.
              </p>
              <p>As we are now?</p>
              <p>I don't see how it's possible anymore.</p>
              <p>
                After everything that has played out, I'm having trouble working
                up sufficient motivation to work on the site and bring it up to
                a serviceable state when combined with the amount of friction
                I've experienced just getting us here.
              </p>
              <p>
                I had hoped to hire outside help or at least raise enough
                through livestreaming other SN related work to offset the costs.
                At this point though I believe that is a lost cause as well. If
                this was the only major problem, it would be bad enough.
                Unfortunately, it's just the tip of a very large and very ugly
                iceberg.
              </p>
              <p>
                The deeper problem is that everything else has bitrotted over
                time.

                SN's backend is something of a jigsaw puzzle which is documented
                in one of three places: on the site, on the internal technical
                wiki (which is currently down), and on the old public facing
                wiki which is also down. None of that documentation was or is
                consistent with the actual state of reality, and quite a few
                parts, like the MySQL cluster, were somewhat esoteric.
              </p>
              <p>
                In practice, if you want to know how anything was plugged into
                anything, it was a matter of pulling cables and figuring out
                what broke. It also doesn't help that the backend is notoriously
                noisy. That makes it hard to sort out real errors from the
                chaff. This was a large part of why the Zoo plugin, which does
                the sidebars, was broken for most of December. It also didn't
                help that we had three different OSes (Ubuntu, CentOS, Gentoo)
                which complicated system administration.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, there have been major disagreements among the
                sysops on actually doing any major upgrades. Someone would
                complain that we should do something. There would be a lot of
                arguments about it. In most cases, nothing got done. Because of
                this ongoing friction, it became increasingly more common for no
                one to install updates. This is why we never upgraded from
                Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 back in 2016. I eventually said we should
                just go to Gentoo, since there was a widespread belief that
                upgrading the distribution would break everything. This
                suggestion ultimately just ended up with only our development
                machine on Gentoo, and that too was woefully out of date.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I finally checked in in November 2022, after two years, the
                site had finally reached a breaking point. I talked with some
                people in #chillax, and I got a state of affairs from
                mechanicjay, and I decided to do what should have been done long
                ago.
              </p>
              <p>Clean house.</p>
              <p>
                I didn't ask for permission. I didn't wait for people to answer
                DMs. I just did it because we had done this go around one too
                many times in the past.
              </p>
              <p>
                I will let the community decide if I was justified or not in
                doing so.
              </p>
              <p>
                A lot of this involved installing over a decade of upgrades.
                Setting up and configuring firewalls and removing unneeded
                services. Backing up and decommissioning old boxes. Given the
                extended period of time without updates, you can imagine that I
                at least have some concern at the number of potentially
                vulnerable backend services that were exposed to the Internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                I found no evidence of breach, but given the period of time, and
                general lack of maintenance, I am at best uneasy.
              </p>
              <p>I could have done better.</p>
              <p>
                In the end, I finally installed almost a decade of upgrades in
                December of 2022, but that only postponed the inevitable. I also
                trimmed the number of machines and services in an effort to be
                at least slightly more secure on the Internet. However,
                ultimately, without a way to bring in new users, SN is slowly
                going to attrition itself to death.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some might argue that I simply let it be, or should have let it
                be in November, but I really did hope that I could pull it out
                of this death spiral. Over the last few months, it has become
                clear that the only way work is going to be done is if I do it
                or if a miracle happens.
              </p>
              <p>The problem is: as part-owner, where do you go from here?</p>
              <p>There's also the matter of liability.</p>
              <p>
                Ultimately speaking, if something happened with SN, Matt and I
                would be jointly responsible since our names are on the legal
                documents. I tried to find someone to take my place, and failed.
                I am legally attached to something that is barely being
                maintained, and frankly, I can't carry this cross any further.
              </p>
              <p><b>My Role In This Outcome</b></p>
              <p>
                I guess this falls down to a lot of my personal responsibility.
                While SN is at its heart a community project, it is also a
                business, one for which I have served as its president for its
                entire life. I really had no idea what I was doing when we
                started, and this had long term effects on SN as a whole. Part
                of this was that we only had subscriptions as a revenue stream.
              </p>
              <p>
                Without a more solid revenue stream, the PBC was essentially
                hostage to the small trickle of money subscriptions. In a
                volunteer organization, it's a matter of "who shows up to do the
                work" dictating the direction of the site.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the early days this wasn't a problem, I had plenty of free
                time, and people were often willing to help. That's largely how
                the site got ported to Apache 2, and why we were able to stay up
                for more than a year. Meanwhile, solving UTF-8 support was one
                of TMB's and MartyB's projects. As the early enthusiasm died off
                and staff began to leave, essential tasks were becoming less and
                less likely to be done.
              </p>
              <p>
                That ultimately created a negative feedback loop in which
                technical debt continued to pile up.
              </p>
              <p>
                SoylentNews also doesn't have a growing community, partially
                because we have very few inbound links, and are fairly low in
                search results. In our early days, folks followed us from
                Slashdot, and some viral posts on places like reddit and
                HackerNew did help to build the community, but this has largely
                evaporated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Growth of some sort is important because communities have a
                natural attrition rate. People leave, die, or otherwise go
                inactive. Year over year, the community has shrunk, primarily
                because we don't bring in a lot of new blood.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, the Internet as a whole has changed. When we
                started, GamerGate was yet to happen. The world couldn't even
                imagine the rise of the Trump presidency. In theory, the
                moderation system should have been able to handle
                disinformation, but the mod system requires a certain critical
                mass to work. Slashdot's mod system could only work as it does
                on a large community, and we found at least one critical flaw
                with its base assumption:
              </p>
              <p>People rarely if ever downvote.</p>
              <p>
                This, combined with ineffective anti-spam meant that it was
                relatively easy to game the system, and allowing bad actors
                outweighed good. My perception was SN's signal to noise ratio
                was becoming more noise year over year, and there were many
                conversations on this, which ultimately went nowhere. For me,
                personally, it finally reached a head with COVID. The amount of
                medical misinformation and similar such disinformation got to
                the point that I felt we needed to drastically overhaul the
                site.
              </p>
              <p>This lead to some very bitter arguments.</p>
              <p>
                Ultimately, I was overruled, and I attempted to resign after
                bitter arguments in the staff channel. My resignation was
                written, but ultimately never posted, and I left on bad terms
                with the staff at the time. Consequently, I remained President
                of the PBC. At that time, I requested Matt remove me from the
                position, but we never formalized this, primarily because there
                was no one to replace me. It should also be noted that we were
                missing a secretary and unable to find a replacement after
                mrcoolbp withdrew due to personal life reasons.
              </p>
              <p>
                I could have, and perhaps should have, forced the issue then,
                but I could still remember how the domain was hijacked in our
                early days, and didn't want this to be a case of sour grapes. I
                also had a reasonable belief that SN would still be maintained
                by the active staff. I turned my attention towards my other
                endeavors such as my YouTube channel and tried to put it behind
                me.
              </p>
              <p>Two years passed.</p>
              <p>
                That was not the end of the infighting, and that ultimately led
                up to TMB leaving in 2021. The site was now running with the
                bare minimum of maintenance mechanicjay supported by audioguy
                could give it with no hope of a long term solution in sight. Had
                I not checked in, and decided to do emergency maintenance, the
                odds are that it would have been a matter of weeks or months
                before a severe system crash would have irreparably corrupted
                the database.
              </p>
              <p>
                As it was, we had two hard crashes that lost weeks of posts.
                There were no functioning backups that I could find.
              </p>
              <p>
                I did two emergency rounds of maintenance that saw the backend
                database replaced with a standard vanilla MySQL instance and
                drastically downsized the number of machines, cutting the
                monthly bill more than half.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, it's become clear to me that this was too little, too
                late.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many of the issues that were present when I resigned were still
                here. At the end of the day, I found myself caught between my
                responsibility towards my site and my own frustrations for what
                it had become. This combined with a personal disaster in my life
                starting in December meant that I had very little time for SN.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was also combined with the dawning realization of how
                difficult it would be to get new sysops and devs to replace
                myself and those that had left. While I was willing at least to
                put some of the legwork in, no one really wanted to sit down and
                help with the business side of things. It felt like everyone
                else decided we should all hum loudly. While we had some
                volunteers for sysops, my lack of time, combined with the
                relatively arcane nature of our backend mostly nothing being
                done.
              </p>
              <p>
                I honestly don't know if there was one specific misstep that led
                to this outcome. However, the need for sites like Slashdot and
                SoylentNews was already passing when we launched. Slashdot is a
                shell of itself, and most of the role of news aggregator is
                taken up with sites like reddit and HackerNews. The need for
                something like SN has largely disappeared.
              </p>
              <p>
                That means for SN to exist, it has to exist for itself, and
                well, that's the rub of it. SN stopped being maintained while I
                was absent. It wasn't being well maintained well before that
                point. It's not going to be maintained now simply because I
                can't justify the time and effort anymore and no one else is
                putting time or effort into this either.
              </p>
              <p>
                Suggestions like running ads to try and pay for some of the
                maintenance costs have either been rejected or at least treated
                with enough skepticism that makes me doubtful it would help.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, I'm tired of fighting over every single issue which in
                the end leads to nothing being done and everyone just walking
                away unhappy.
              </p>
              <p><b>What Would Have Been Needed To Save SN?</b></p>
              <p>
                As before, I'll break this into two sections, involving the
                technical, and the non-technical. To summarize, it essentially
                required people to take responsibility and pledge to fix it as
                well as relieve me from my position from the PBC.
              </p>
              <p>
                Technically speaking, we'd need to be able to refresh the site
                infrastructure as well as the site's backend dependencies.
                You're essentially dealing with a legacy Linux install that has
                been upgraded from Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubuntu 22.04 that at least a
                dozen of sysops have worked on.
              </p>
              <p>
                To reduce site admin burden, we'd probably end up migrating
                email, and most services beside IRC and the website to third
                party hosting providers. This would have solved many of the
                email and registration issues that have plagued the site since
                GMail made their spam barriers extremely hostile to external
                SMTP hosted mail.
              </p>
              <p>
                We would also need a development environment that properly
                tracked with production to allow changes to be done
                incrementally and rolled back, something that was a continuous
                problem throughout every major site upgrade. This would let us
                test each aspect of the overhaul and deploy it piecemeal instead
                of having the site be broken for weeks or months as happened
                with the much smaller November upgrade.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ideally, we would use an automation deployment solution such as
                GitHub Actions which would make sure the machine state was
                always in sync with the build files, and allow for easy and
                rapid deployment of backend patches and security updates.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this all done, it would have allowed site maintenance to
                easily be done en masse to all machines and without risk of the
                site breaking in new and arcane ways.
              </p>
              <p>
                I did talk to Matt about the possibility of either fundraising
                or selling stock in an effort to finance it.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also made multiple efforts to find someone who was willing to
                seriously take over the site and take over the PBC. There were a
                few email discussions that went ultimately nowhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                What it boils down to is that to do anything with the site, I
                would have to put in legwork that, after everything that has
                been said and done, I am no longer willing to do nor is anyone
                truly stepping in to try and take over for me.
              </p>
              <p>
                It doesn't help that nearly every single thing I've laid out
                here was shot down by at least one other member of staff while
                at the same time no realistic alternatives were worked on or
                even proposed.
              </p>
              <p><b>What Happens Now?</b></p>
              <p>
                At this point, we need to get the expenses of the PBC to zero.
                We have about $1,500 USD in the bank, most of which will go to
                handle our shutdown fees. I want to give a window for people to
                exchange contact info and write goodbyes. Subscriptions will be

                    A thorough investigation has found that the inner core of
                    the Moon is, in fact, a solid ball with a density similar to
                    that of iron. This, researchers hope, will help settle a
                    long debate about whether the Moon's inner heart is solid or
                    molten, and lead to a more accurate understanding of the
                    Moon's history – and, by extension, that of the Solar
                    System.

                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05935-7"
                      >writes a team led by astronomer Arthur Briaud</a

                    of the French National Centre for Scientific Research in
                    France, "question the evolution of the Moon magnetic field
                    thanks to its demonstration of the existence of the inner
                    core and support a global mantle overturn scenario that
                    brings substantial insights on the timeline of the lunar
                    bombardment in the first billion years of the Solar System."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] To figure it out once and for all, Briaud and his
                    colleagues collected data from space missions and lunar
                    laser ranging experiments to compile a profile of various
                    lunar characteristics. These include the degree of its
                    deformation by its gravitational interaction with Earth, the
                    variation in its distance from Earth, and its density.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] And they found that the lunar core is very similar to
                    that of Earth – with an outer fluid layer and a solid inner
                    core. According to their modeling, the outer core has a
                    radius of about 362 kilometers (225 miles), and the inner
                    core has a radius of about 258 kilometers (160 miles).
                    That's about 15 percent of the entire radius of the Moon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The inner core, the team found, also has a density of about
                    7,822 kilograms per cubic meter. That's very close to the
                    density of iron.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [..] We know not long after it formed, the Moon had a
                    powerful magnetic field, which started to decline about 3.2
                    billion years ago. Such a magnetic field is generated by
                    motion and convection in the core, so what the lunar core is
                    made of is deeply relevant to how and why the magnetic field
                    disappeared.

                    Intel quietly released a new whitepaper and specification
                    for their proposal on "X86-S" as a 64-bit only x86
                    architecture. If their plans workout, in the years ahead we
                    could see a revised 64-bit only x86 architecture.

                    Entitled "Envisioning a Simplified Intel Architecture",
                    Intel engineers lay the case for a 64-bit mode-only
                    architecture. Intel is still said to be investigating the
                    64-bit mode-only architecture that they also refer to as
                    "x86S". Intel is hoping to solicit industry feedback while
                    they continue to explore a 64-bit mode only ISA.

                  <p>
                    [...] Under this proposal, those wanting to run legacy
                    32-bit operating systems would have to rely on
                    virtualization. To further clarify, 32-bit x86 user-space
                    software would continue to work on modern 64-bit operating
                    systems with X86-S.

                    tended toward proposals, such as opt-outs and policy
                    notices, that will do little to curb the misuse of AI
                    systems. The key to effective legislation will be to
                    allocate rights and responsibilities for AI developers and
                    users. This allocation will necessarily be asymmetric as
                    those who are designing the big models are far more able to
                    control outcomes and minimize risk than those who will be

                    in March 2021, when there were even fewer details about the
                    test. It is still unclear which telecom companies were
                    involved. The Home Office's February report is the first
                    official indication that the trial was useful to law
                    enforcement, and could help lay the groundwork for expanding
                    the system across the UK. The Home Office review also states
                    its trial found that "ICRs appear to be currently out of
                    reach for some potentially key investigations," raising the
                    possibility that the law may be changed in the future.

                    details of an internal review into ICRs, citing national
                    security and law enforcement grounds. A Home Office
                    spokesperson said the UK has "one of the most robust and
                    transparent oversight regimes for the protection of personal
                    data and privacy anywhere in the world" and confirmed that
                    trials of ICRs are ongoing.

                    collect more of people's data doesn't result in "more
                    security" for people. "Building the data retention
                    capabilities of companies and a vast range of government
                    agencies doesn't mean that intelligence operations will be
                    enhanced," Haidar says. "In fact, we argue that it makes us
                    less secure as this data becomes vulnerable to being misused
                    or abused."

                    in tax law that took effect this year has stakeholders
                    worried the mounting debt bubble will finally become fatal.
                    A San Francisco politician introduced a law this year in the
                    state legislature that would crack down on pot businesses
                    that don't pay their debts.

                    State law recently shifted the burden for paying cannabis
                    excise taxes from distributors to retailers, with the first
                    tax payments due May 1. Retailers have historically had the
                    most trouble paying their bills, and it appears that many
                    shops lack the cash to pay their state excise taxes,
                    according to new state tax data obtained by SFGATE.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Over 13% of California's retailers, or 265 pot shops, failed
                    to make any tax payment by the May 1 deadline, according to
                    the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration.
                    Those businesses are now facing a 50% penalty on the taxes
                    they owe, which could be a death blow to many shops.

                    Like motion sickness, cybersickness can occur when there's a
                    mismatch between visual motion and body motion. Symptoms,
                    including nausea, dizziness, headaches and eye fatigue,
                    usually resolve quickly after removing the headset. But in
                    severe cases, they sometimes last for hours.

                    to cybersickness, the ISU researchers recruited 150
                    participants to play up to 20 minutes of a VR game with a
                    headset. The participants were new to VR and could stop if
                    they felt too sick to continue. The researchers found women
                    ended the game early twice as often as men and reported a
                    sickness intensity that was 40% higher.

                    individual's pupils could help explain the gender difference
                    in cybersickness. VR headsets have an adjustable lens set-up
                    to accommodate different users, but some people fall outside
                    the range. The researchers found women participants on
                    average had smaller distances between their pupils than men,
                    but it did not predict whether they would get cybersick

                    What seemed to matter more was whether they had previous
                    experience with motion sickness or screen sickness
                    (<em>e.g</em>., feeling sick in movie theaters, while

                    One of the greatest cartoons of the modern era is making a
                    return after a 10-year layoff, and you won't have to wait
                    long to start enjoying brand new episodes. The first new
                    episode of season eight will premiere on Hulu on July 24,
                    with subsequent episodes to follow on Mondays.

                    Hulu ordered a 20-episode run of Futurama in February of
                    last year that will see much of the original show's voice
                    actors and crew return, including executive producers Matt
                    Groening (The Simpsons) and David X. Cohen (Beavis and
                    Butt-Head). Billy West, Katey Sagal, Maurice LaMarche, Tress
                    MacNeille, Lauren Tom, Phil LaMarr, and David Herman are all
                    back, as is John DiMaggio who voices Bender.

                  <p>
                    Futurama premiered on Fox in the spring of 1999 and ran on
                    the network for five seasons before getting canceled. The
                    show would return in 2010 for a two season run on Comedy
                    Central, with the final episode of that deal airing on
                    September 4, 2013. The order with Hulu will mark the
                    program's third platform, or fourth if you count the direct
                    to DVD movies.

                    will initially consist of 10 episodes. It is unclear if the
                    remaining 10 episodes from the original order will arrive as
                    a second half of season eight or a new season entirely.

                    while Futurama diehards will be rewarded with payoffs to
                    longstanding mysteries. Highlights are said to include
                    developments in the relationship of Fry and Leela, the
                    contents of Nibbler's litter box, the whereabouts of Kif and
                    Amy's tadpoles, and the history of evil Robot Santa.

                    We're still early in the snowball effect unleashed by the
                    release of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT into
                    the wild. Paired with the open-sourcing of other GPT
                    (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) models, the number of
                    applications employing AI is exploding; and as we know,
                    ChatGPT itself can be used to create highly advanced
                    malware.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As time passes, applied LLMs will only increase, each
                    specializing in their own area, trained on carefully curated
                    data for a specific purpose. And one such application just
                    dropped, one that was trained on data from the dark web
                    itself.

                    DarkBERT is based on the RoBERTa architecture, an AI
                    approach developed back in 2019. It has seen a renaissance
                    of sorts, with researchers discovering it actually had more
                    performance to give than could be extracted from it in 2019.

                  <p>
                    "Fundamentally, there's been an increasing gap between
                    salary and the costs of housing that the standard pay rise
                    isn't covering, and it's pushing teachers further away from
                    their workplaces or out of the profession entirely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The issue is not just limited to teachers, but all
                    essential workers who are increasingly finding it difficult
                    to find affordable places to live within a reasonable
                    distance of their
                  </p>

                    "The school system is struggling to find enough teachers as
                    it is," Prof. Eacott says. "If teachers can't afford to live
                    near or within reasonable commuting distance of their
                    schools, we can only expect those shortfalls to continue to
                    grow."

                  <p>
                    [...] Prof. Eacott says part of the challenge is that no
                    single government department or the private sector is
                    ultimately responsible for housing essential workers. While
                    more investment from superannuation funds in essential
                    worker housing developments is welcome, it won't be enough
                    to address the issue at scale.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The simple answer is we do need to be paying teachers more.
                    But that may not necessarily solve supply problems," Prof.
                    Eacott says. "For example, it is just incredibly difficult
                    right now for teachers to find a place to rent given record
                    low vacancy rates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's also important that we're not confining teachers to
                    just teacher apartments, but creating pathways to home
                    ownership."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We rely so much on our teachers, so it's only fair we
                    take steps towards providing them and other essential
                    workers with affordable and secure housing options," Prof.
                    Eacott says.

                Much of the wreck lies in two main pieces, far apart from each
                other, at a depth of about 4,000 meters. Around 700k images

                    Personality is usually summarized in five traits - the
                    so-called "big five": Emotional stability (neuroticism),
                    extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and
                    openness. Our personality then shapes our decision-making
                    style. In a research study from Lund University, Swedish
                    obstetricians' and gynecologists' personality profiles and
                    clinical experience are linked for the first time to their
                    decision-making styles in acute childbirth situations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Obstetricians and gynecologists have a personality profile
                    that differs significantly from the population at large. On
                    average, 85 percent of Sweden's population has significantly
                    lower emotional stability, extroversion, agreeableness, and
                    conscientiousness than the obstetricians in our study. It's
                    hard not to be surprised when the differences are so clear",
                    says Petri Kajonius, associate professor of personality
                    psychology and behavioral measurement at Lund University.

                    It is our personality that defines what we will enjoy in our
                    professional life, and the consequence is likely a
                    self-selection of people who seek a certain profession.
                    Swedish obstetric-focused physicians' personalities make
                    them comfortable in an environment where a childbirth
                    situation can quickly shift to something acute and
                    potentially escalate into a crisis. Here, traits such as
                    emotional stability and conscientiousness are prominent.

                How do you assess your own personal emotional stability. Are you
                excitable, or calm and methodical, or does it change frequently
                depending upon the current situation that you find yourself?

                    higher density. Two types of CFETs are currently being
                    researched — monolithic and sequential. The four devices on
                    the right side of the above image detail various proposed
                    CFET designs. For now, it is unclear which type of design
                    Intel would adopt, or if it will devise another type of
                    implementation. Given that imec doesn't have CFETs on its
                    roadmap until around when chips shrink to 5 angstroms in the
                    2032 timeframe, it could be some time before we find out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That said, it isn't guaranteed that Intel would target CFET
                    in that timeframe: Interestingly, Intel's slide shows its
                    next-gen GAA nanosheet transistor (RibbonFET) and then jumps
                    directly to CFET, omitting the GAA forksheet transistors
                    that most think will be the step between nanosheet and CFET.
                    You can also see that type of transistor in the above slide
                    — it is the second from the left.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Given that Intel's image isn't very detailed, it is possible
                    that the company also plans to use forksheet transistors
                    before it moves to CFET, but it hasn't chosen to share the
                    details yet. We're following up with Intel to see if we can
                    learn any more details.

                    Reddit announced Thursday that it will now allow users to
                    upload NSFW images from desktops in adult communities. The
                    feature was already available on the social network's mobile
                    app.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "This now gives us feature parity with our mobile
                    apps, which (as you know) already has this functionality.
                    You must set your community to 18+ if your community's
                    content will primarily be not safe for work (NSFW)," the
                    company said.

                  <p>
                    Reddit's announcement comes days after Imgur said that the
                    image hosting platform
                    <a
                      href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/20/imgur-will-ban-explicit-images-on-its-platform-this-month/"
                      >was banning explicit photos from May 15</a
                    >. At that time, the company said that explicit content
                    formed a risk to Imgur's "community and its business".
                    Banning this type of content would "protect the future of
                    the Imgur community."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Many of Reddit's communities rely on Imgur's hosting
                    services. However, the social network allowing native NSFW
                    uploads through desktop might be the most logical solution
                    going forward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Image hosting is not the only hurdle for NSFW communities.
                    Last month, when Reddit announced that it will

                      >start charging for its API</a
                    >, the company also said that it will limit access to mature
                    content available through its API. This would directly
                    impact the experience on third-party Reddit apps. In
                    yesterday's announcement about desktop upload for NSFW
                    images, a Reddit staff members

                    Video Visit Asia's emerging megacities and you'll quickly
                    notice that scooters and motorbikes vastly outnumber cars.
                    Before long these fleets of two-wheelers will become
                    battery-powered, always-connected, semi-autonomous machines
                    that offer an even more potent alternative to their
                    four-wheeled rivals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The reasons powered two-wheelers dominate nations such as
                    India, Indonesia and Vietnam – with a combined population
                    over 1.75 billion – are simple: cars are unaffordable on
                    local wages, few urban homes have space to store them, and
                    warm climates make two-wheelers viable year-round. Plus,
                    many of them sell for less than the equivalent of $1,000
                    apiece.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The industry has decided many will soon be electric and it
                    looks like drivers will buy them.

                    "Electrification of micromobility can be adopted at a faster
                    pace than cars, mainly because the motor and batteries are
                    much smaller," Fook Fah Yap, a director at Singapore's
                    Nanyang Technical University's Transport Research Centre
                    told <i>The Register</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Evidence of the shift is not hard to find. Earlier this year
                    Honda announced it will start to sell 10 battery-powered
                    bikes in 2025. Yamaha expects 90 percent of its sales will
                    be electrified by 2050 and Toyota is expected to announce an
                    electric two-wheeler this year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Two—wheelers, by contrast, are all about getting from
                    A to B, quickly and at low cost. Digital technology's role
                    in a two-wheeler is therefore all about information related
                    to navigation.

                    First discovered 60 years ago, quasars can shine as brightly
                    as a trillion stars packed into a volume the size of our
                    Solar System. In the decades since they were first observed,
                    it has remained a mystery what could trigger such powerful
                    activity. New work led by scientists at the Universities of
                    Sheffield and Hertfordshire has now revealed that it is a
                    consequence of galaxies crashing together.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The collisions were discovered when researchers, using deep
                    imaging observations from the Isaac Newton Telescope in La
                    Palma, observed the presence of distorted structures in the
                    outer regions of the galaxies that are home to quasars.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most galaxies have supermassive black holes at their
                    centres. They also contain substantial amounts of gas – but
                    most of the time this gas is orbiting at large distances
                    from the galaxy centres, out of reach of the black holes.
                    Collisions between galaxies drive the gas towards the black
                    hole at the galaxy centre; just before the gas is consumed
                    by the black hole, it releases extraordinary amounts of
                    energy in the form of radiation, resulting in the
                    characteristic quasar brilliance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This is the first time that a sample of quasars of
                    this size has been imaged with this level of sensitivity. By
                    comparing observations of 48 quasars and their host galaxies
                    with images of over 100 non-quasar galaxies, researchers
                    concluded that galaxies hosting quasars are approximately
                    three times as likely to be interacting or colliding with
                    other galaxies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study has provided a significant step forward in our
                    understanding of how these powerful objects are triggered
                    and fuelled.

                Researchers have uncovered malicious firmware that can turn
                residential and small office routers into proxies for Chinese
                state-sponsored hackers. The firmware implant, discovered by
                Check Point Research, includes a full-featured backdoor that
                allows attackers to establish communication, issue commands, and
                perform file transfers with infected devices. The implant was
                found in TP-Link routers but could be modified to work on other
                router models.
              </p>
              <p>
                The malware's main purpose is to relay traffic between infected
                targets and command-and-control servers, obscuring the origins
                and destinations of the communication. The control
                infrastructure was traced back to hackers associated with the
                Chinese government. By using a chain of infected devices, the
                attackers can hide the final command and control and make it
                difficult for defenders to detect and respond to the attack.

                This technique of using routers and other IoT devices as proxies
                is a common tactic among threat actors. The researchers are
                unsure how the implant is installed on devices but suspect it
                could be through exploiting vulnerabilities or weak
                administrative credentials.

                While the firmware image discovered so far only affects TP-Link
                devices, the modular design allows the threat actors to create
                images for a wider range of hardware. The article concludes with
                recommendations for users to check for potential infections and
                apply proactive mitigations such as patching routers and using
                strong passwords.

                    The researchers further concluded that their analysis
                    supports the use of junk food taxes implemented as excise
                    taxes paid by manufacturers or distributors, rather than
                    sales taxes that need to be administered by retailers and
                    paid directly by consumers. Revenue from excise taxes can be
                    earmarked for particular uses, including improving access to
                    healthy food in low-resource communities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "An advantage of excise taxes is that food companies may be
                    motivated to reformulate their products to be healthier to
                    avoid taxation," said study co-author Sean Cash of the
                    Friedman School at Tufts. "Defining foods to be taxed is not
                    a static exercise, as existing products are reformulated and
                    thousands of new packaged foods are introduced each year—so
                    how we tax foods is not just a tool for steering consumers
                    away from the least healthy options, but also for
                    encouraging healthy innovations in what ends up on the
                    supermarket shelves."

                    As zip and mov are now two generally approved TLDs, internet

                    URLs to open in a web browser. Cyber-criminals have already
                    started to exploit the new gTLDs, with a now-defunct

                    Trapped in the bio-oil, Charm Industrial thinks it can store
                    the CO2 underground for thousands to millions of years to
                    keep it from making climate change worse. That's how the
                    startup can now sell carbon removal credits, representing
                    tons of captured CO2, to companies that want to use its
                    service to try to cancel out some of its own carbon dioxide
                    pollution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So far, Charm has successfully stored more than 6,100 metric
                    tons of CO2 in the form of bio-oil. (A previous purchase
                    from Microsoft, at 2,000 metric tons of CO2, is a big chunk
                    of that.) So the deal announced today is a major escalation
                    and a vote of confidence from Big Tech companies that have
                    been early backers of the nascent carbon removal industry.

                  <p>
                    The advantage Charm says it has is that its plan is
                    decentralized. Other companies are building big plants to

                    A key component of any processor is instruction decoding:
                    analyzing a numeric opcode and figuring out what actions
                    need to be taken. The Intel 8086 processor (1978) has a
                    complex instruction set, making instruction decoding a
                    challenge. The first step in decoding an 8086 instruction is
                    something called the Group Decode ROM, which categorizes
                    instructions into about 35 types that control how the
                    instruction is decoded and executed. For instance, the Group
                    Decode ROM determines if an instruction is executed in
                    hardware or in microcode. It also indicates how the
                    instruction is structured: if the instruction has a bit
                    specifying a byte or word operation, if the instruction has
                    a byte that specifies the addressing mode, and so forth.
