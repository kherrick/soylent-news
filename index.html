                    While Google has been dealing with fierce competition on all
                    sides and is investing a lot into infusing AI into as many
                    products as it can, its ads business, the company’s bread
                    and butter, is still humming along. The Search business
                    earned $44 billion, an 11 percent jump year over year. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The big question coming up is how Google’s focus on AI will
                    impact that core business. Google’s AI-powered

                    [SGE] is still only available on an opt-in basis, so we
                    don’t yet know how much it’ll impact the company’s ad
                    business.

                  <p>
                    Google is already moving to head off that problem. On
                    Google’s earnings call, CEO Sundar Pichai said that the
                    company would be experimenting with new formats native to
                    the way SGE works — the company has
                    <a
                      href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/23/23734609/google-search-generative-experience-sge-ai"
                      >already shown off some ideas</a
                    >
                    — so perhaps we’ll start to see some of those formats debut
                    in the coming weeks and months. Later in the call, chief
                    business officer Philipp Schindler added that “it’s
                    extremely important to us that in this new experience,
                    advertisers still have the opportunity to reach potential
                    customers along their search journeys.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As the company rolls out SGE, “we are making sure the
                    product works well, and we’re generating value for our
                    ecosystem and that ads transition well,” Pichai said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Infusing AI in search is a long-term play for Google. Pichai
                    said he sees an opportunity to “evolve search and Assistant
                    over the next decade ahead.” Last quarter, he declared that
                    over time,

                      >SGE will “just be how search works,”</a
                    >
                    and given the comments about ads on Tuesday’s call, it seems
                    the company is starting to think seriously about how to make
                    its AI-powered search into more of a business.

                    [...] Another strength of the <em>Pediatrics</em> research
                    is that it incorporates the two cohort studies, one testing
                    patients within days of their concussions and the other
                    after three months.

                  <p>
                    "That makes our claim even stronger," says Ware. "We can
                    demonstrate that even in those first days and weeks after
                    concussion, when children do show symptoms such as a pain
                    and slow processing speed, there's no hit to their IQs. Then
                    it's the same story three months out, when most children
                    have recovered from their concussion symptoms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Thanks to this study we can say that, consistently, we
                    would not expect IQ to be diminished from when children are
                    symptomatic to when they've recovered."

                    Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved a project to
                    build an Orbital Station following a meeting regarding the
                    development of the country's space industry. Moscow
                    mouthpiece TASS
                    <a href="https://tass.com/science/1697645">reported</a> the
                    move, and lurking within the grandstanding about space
                    station ambitions was an admission of how much Russia's
                    human spaceflight program still depends on the International
                    Space Station (ISS).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Roscosmos boss Yuri Borisov said the funds have been
                    allocated and the green light given to start work on the
                    project. This is convenient because the prospects for
                    Russian human spaceflight will start to look bleak once the
                    ISS hurtles back to Earth around 2030. According to TASS,
                    Borisov said that ensuring the continuity of Russia's
                    program was a "pressing task" and he added that there was a
                    genuine risk of a situation where "the ISS is no longer
                    there, and the Russian station is not yet there."

                    Considering the lengthy delays associated with space
                    programs, the timelines are ambitious. The first component –
                    the scientific and energy module – is supposedly planned for
                    late 2027 and will be followed by others between 2028 and
                    2030.

                  <p>
                    The plan calls for the first crew to be launched six months
                    after the first module launch.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to the timelines reported by TASS, Russia
                    intends to construct, test, and launch the first element of
                    its space station in four years. Hopefully, with a puncture
                    repair kit on board.

                    Researchers at Stockholm University have unveiled the hidden
                    intricacies of how sperm go from passive bystanders to
                    dynamic swimmers. This transformation is a pivotal step in
                    the journey to fertilization, and it hinges on the
                    activation of a unique ion transporter. Their research has
                    been
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06518-2"
                      >published</a
                    >
                    in <i>Nature</i>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Imagine sperm as tiny adventurers on a quest to reach the
                    ultimate treasure, the egg. They don't have a map, but they
                    make use of something even more extraordinary:
                    chemo-attractants. These are chemical signals released by
                    the egg that act as siren call, directing and activating the
                    sperm. When these signals bind to receptors on the sperm's
                    surface, it triggers a series of events, starting their
                    movement towards the egg. And in this intricate scenario,
                    one key player is a protein known as "SLC9C1."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's exclusively found in sperm cells, and it is usually not
                    active. However, when the chemo-attractants interact with
                    the sperm's surface, everything changes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The activation of SLC9C1 is driven by a change in
                    voltage that occurs when chemo-attractants attach to the
                    sperm. To accomplish this, SLC9C1 uses a unique feature
                    called a voltage-sensing domain (VSD). Typically, VSD
                    domains are associated with voltage-gated ion channels. But
                    in the case of SLC9C1, it's something truly exceptional in
                    the realm of transporters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers, led by David Drew, have unveiled the secrets
                    behind SLC9C1's inner workings and provides the first
                    example of voltage-sensing domain activation of a
                    transporter and its connection via an unusually long
                    voltage-sensing (S4) helix.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Transporters work very differently than channels and,
                    as such, the VSD is coupled to the sperm protein in a way
                    that we have just never seen before, or even imagined. Its
                    exciting to see how nature has done this and perhaps, in the
                    future, we can learn from this to make synthetic proteins
                    that can be turned-on by voltage or develop novel male
                    contraceptives that work by blocking this protein," David
                    Drew notes.

                    countries who are suspected of assisting illicit tech sales.
                    These rules were originally slated to go into effect 30 days
                    after publication, but it appears Uncle Sam is moving
                    forward with uncharacteristic speed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an 8K filing released on Monday, Nvidia advised it has
                    received notice from the US Government that the rules
                    governing the sale of AI chips to China were "effective
                    immediately, impacting shipments of the company’s A100,
                    A800, H100, H800, and L40S products."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Notably missing from this list is Nvidia's RTX 4090, the
                    company’s mightiest gaming GPU. While the export controls
                    are largely targeted at datacenter products, there are rules
                    to prevent the highest performance consumer GPUs from being
                    sold in China without license. Nvidia in its initial SEC
                    <a
                      href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581023000217/nvda-20231017.htm"

                    warned that sales of the RTX 4090 in China would likely be
                    impacted by sanctions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While sale of the A100 and H100 kit in China was already
                    restricted under the previous round of export controls,
                    Nvidia expected it would be allowed to continue selling its
                    less powerful A800, H800, and L40S GPUs in China for a
                    little while longer.

                    [...] And, as we learned this summer, there are a lot of
                    Chinese companies waiting on Nvidia GPUs. According to a
                    <em>Financial Times</em>
                    <a
                      href="https://www.ft.com/content/9dfee156-4870-4ca4-b67d-bb5a285d855c"
                      >report</a
                    >
                    from August, Chinese web giants, including Alibaba, Baidu,
                    ByteDance, and Tencent, had ordered a $1 billion worth of
                    A800s and had committed to buying another $4 billion worth
                    of GPUs from Nvidia in 2024. It now appears most of those
                    orders could be left unfulfilled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite this change, Nvidia doesn't expect the accelerated
                    timeline to cause too many problems for its own bottom line.
                    "Given the strength of demand for the company's products
                    worldwide, the Company does not anticipate that the
                    accelerated time of the licensing requirements will have a
                    near-term meaningful impact on its financial results," the
                    SEC filing reads.

                    [...] . That's what it's not. What actually is NorthPole?
                    Some of the ideas do carry forward from IBM's earlier
                    efforts. These include the recognition that a lot of the
                    energy costs of AI come from the separation between memory
                    and execution units. Since a key component of neural
                    networks—the weight of connections between different layers
                    of "neurons"—is held in memory, any execution on a
                    traditional processor or GPU burns a lot of energy simply
                    getting those weights from memory to where they can be used
                    during execution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So NorthPole, like TrueNorth before it, consists of a large
                    array (16×16) of computational units, each of which includes
                    both local memory and code execution capacity. So, all of
                    the weights of various connections in the neural network can
                    be stored exactly where they're needed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Executing neural networks on the chip is also a relatively
                    unusual process. Once the weights and connections of the
                    neural network are placed in buffers on the chip, execution
                    simply requires an external controller—typically a CPU—to
                    upload the data it's meant to operate on (such as an image)
                    and tell it to start. Everything else runs to completion
                    without the CPU's involvement, which should also limit the
                    system-level power consumption.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] While the tests were run with the NorthPole processor
                    installed on a PCIe card, IBM told Ars that the chip is
                    still viewed as a research prototype, and additional work
                    would be needed to convert it into a commercial product. The
                    company did not indicate whether it would be pursuing
                    commercialization, though.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the potential limitations of the system is that it
                    can only run neural networks that fit within its hardware.
                    Put too many nodes in a single layer, and NorthPole cannot
                    deal with it. But there is the possibility of splitting up
                    layers and executing segments of them on multiple NorthPole
                    chips in parallel. The hardware has the capacity to handle
                    this, but it hasn't been tested as of yet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Perhaps the biggest limitation, however, is that this is
                    specialized for a single category of AI task. While it's a
                    commonly used one, the efficiency here comes largely from
                    designing hardware that's a good match to the type of
                    execution needed by inference tasks. So, while it's good to
                    see the effort put into dropping the power demands of some
                    AI workloads, we're not at the point yet where we can have a
                    single accelerator that works for all cases.

                    Three years ago, Apple introduced a privacy-enhancing
                    feature that hid the Wi-Fi address of iPhones and iPads when
                    they joined a network. On Wednesday, the world learned that
                    the feature has never worked as advertised. Despite promises
                    that this never-changing address would be hidden and
                    replaced with a private one that was unique to each SSID,
                    Apple devices have continued to display the real one, which
                    in turn got broadcast to every other connected device on the
                    network.<br />[...]<br />In 2020, Apple released iOS 14 with
                    a feature that, by default,
                    <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102509"
                      >hid Wi-Fi MACs</a
                    >
                    when devices connected to a network. Instead, the device
                    displayed what Apple called a "private Wi-Fi address" that
                    was different for each SSID. Over time, Apple has enhanced
                    the feature, for instance, by allowing users to assign a new
                    private Wi-Fi address for a given SSID.

                      >released iOS 17.1</a
                    >. Among the various fixes was a patch for a vulnerability,
                    tracked as

                      >CVE-2023-42846</a
                    >, which prevented the privacy feature from working. Tommy
                    Mysk, one of the two security researchers Apple credited
                    with discovering and reporting the vulnerability (Talal Haj
                    Bakry was the other), told Ars that he tested all recent iOS
                    releases and found the flaw dates back to version 14,
                    released in September 2020.

                    "From the get-go, this feature was useless because of this
                    bug," he said. "We couldn't stop the devices from sending
                    these discovery requests, even with a VPN. Even in the
                    Lockdown Mode."

                    Despite its mounting cost and schedule delays, NASA remains
                    committed to MSR, and the newly formed response team is
                    trying to find a path forward for the mission given the
                    bleak assessment made by the review board. “We’re looking to
                    harvest as much of the work that we’ve done to date as
                    possible, but also stepping back and looking at ways we can
                    reduce cost and increasing resilience,” Jeff Gramling, MSR
                    director at NASA, is quoted in SpaceNews as saying.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Despite giving it a bad review for execution, the
                    report did highlight the importance of the mission. “A
                    successful MSR campaign will revolutionize our understanding
                    of the history of Mars, the Solar System, and the potential
                    for life beyond Earth,” the report read.

                  <p>
                    For that reason, NASA is moving forward with its plan to
                    return samples from Mars while also trying not to have it
                    impact the rest of the space agency’s scientific endeavors.

                    EU legislators on Tuesday voted to slash use of pesticides
                    by half across the bloc, despite opposition from some
                    conservative groups. But green politicians were left to
                    regret the rejection of a proposed symbolic declaration
                    calling for a complete ban on controversial weedkiller
                    glyphosate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A parliamentary commission rejected making a declaration a
                    month before the 27 member states are due to decide on
                    appeal whether to extend the use of glyphosate, something
                    the WHO fears could be carcinogenic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Earlier this month the bloc failed to agree to do so as
                    divisions emerged and the matter will now go to an appeals
                    committee in early November. Tuesday saw the EU's
                    environment committee vote by a narrow majority—47 votes to
                    37—to set binding targets on reduced pesticide use that
                    targets a 50-percent reduction by 2030.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The pesticides judged the most hazardous will see use pared
                    back by two-thirds compared with 2013-2017. The committee
                    has also banned use of pesticides in designated sensitive
                    areas, including public parks, around schools and at Natura
                    2000 protection sites.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among those voting against were the rightwing European
                    People's Party and the far right, while farmers and
                    agri-cooperatives are opposed to seeing the EU impose too
                    tight a set of regulations in the sector.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Austrian Green MEP Sarah Wiener, leading the campaign
                    on the issue, said she was pleased at an outcome bringing
                    agreement "on feasible compromises in an
                    ideologically-charged and industry-dominated discussion."
                    Belgian Socialist lawmaker Marie Arena said the outcome
                    would benefit farmworkers and the environment alike as
                    "abusive use of pesticides makes people sick," as well as
                    decimating bee numbers.

                    Presently most carbon taxes are uniform across all economic
                    sectors - and in the developed nations, their impact
                    disproportionately affects people on lower incomes and are
                    not extensive enough to have a "profound impact on
                    emissions".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers say a differentiated carbon tax system would
                    be fairer as the tax would set higher rates for users of
                    luxury goods and services, which are predominantly consumed
                    by the better off.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under the theoretical model described in the paper, the
                    revenues generated from the carbon tax could be used to
                    retrofit insulation in the homes of poorer families to
                    reduce domestic energy consumption.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The scheme we are proposing will introduce a higher
                    carbon tax for luxury goods, such as flying long-haul or
                    driving a high-performance car, and a lower carbon tax for
                    goods and services that meet basic human needs, such as
                    providing housing, cooking and healthcare."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the study team warn that if a luxury goods taxation
                    scheme is to work and deliver significant reductions in
                    carbon dioxide emissions, in line with those set out in the
                    Paris Agreement, it needs to be introduced "promptly,
                    universally and with high and rapidly rising carbon prices
                    as compared to any policy currently in place".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A fair and luxury-focused carbon taxation system is
                    needed because technological solutions alone will not
                    deliver the reduction in carbon emissions that are needed to
                    keep global warming within 1.5 °C. If those solutions do
                    come along, the researchers say the taxation system could
                    then be suitably amended.
                  </p>

                    "It cannot remain status quo to continue environmentally
                    damaging luxury activities unabated while awaiting a
                    technology fix," they say.

                    Do you feel it? The sense that this civilization has run out
                    of creative juice. That we've reached the cliff edge of the

                    That big ideas are dead, killed off by the technocrats of
                    the ruling class. If an idea is proposed that doesn't grow

                    This sense struck me hard recently reading BBC Focus, a
                    popular science magazine. One of the articles was about a
                    team of university researchers in California using AI to
                    predict hit pop songs.

                    Professor Paul Zack said: "Streaming services can readily
                    identify new songs that are likely to be hits for people's
                    playlists more efficiently, making the streaming services
                    jobs easier and delighting listeners."

                    There is so much of this going about. Click on any science

                    sense of inquiry that I've read used to exist in the world?
                    It wasn't so long ago that people would spend years writing
                    history-changing theses articulating political, economic,

                    The ocean's color has changed significantly over the last 20
                    years, and the global trend is likely a consequence of
                    human-induced climate change, report scientists at MIT, the
                    National Oceanography Center in the U.K., and elsewhere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a study appearing today in <em>Nature</em>, the team
                    writes that they have detected changes in ocean color over
                    the past two decades that cannot be explained by natural,
                    year-to-year variability alone. These color shifts, though
                    subtle to the human eye, have occurred over 56 percent of
                    the world's oceans — an expanse that is larger than the
                    total land area on Earth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In particular, the researchers found that tropical ocean
                    regions near the equator have become steadily greener over
                    time. The shift in ocean color indicates that ecosystems
                    within the surface ocean must also be changing, as the color
                    of the ocean is a literal reflection of the organisms and
                    materials in its waters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "I've been running simulations that have been telling
                    me for years that these changes in ocean color are going to
                    happen," says study co-author Stephanie Dutkiewicz, senior
                    research scientist in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric
                    and Planetary Sciences and the Center for Global Change
                    Science. "To actually see it happening for real is not
                    surprising, but frightening. And these changes are
                    consistent with man-induced changes to our climate."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "The color of the oceans has changed," Dutkiewicz
                    says. "And we can't say how. But we can say that changes in
                    color reflect changes in plankton communities, that will
                    impact everything that feeds on plankton. It will also
                    change how much the ocean will take up carbon, because
                    different types of plankton have different abilities to do
                    that. So, we hope people take this seriously. It's not only
                    models that are predicting these changes will happen. We can
                    now see it happening, and the ocean is changing."

                    To Shelby Mustang fans, the Original Venice Crew (OVC) is
                    the stuff of legends. This was the actual team that designed
                    and built the original GT350s, Cobras, Daytona Coupes, and
                    GT40s that introduced Carroll Shelby's name to the masses.
                    Today, OVC builds modern Mustang recreations so accurate
                    that one was approved for last year's Le Mans Classic, which
                    celebrated 100 years of the world's most famous endurance
                    race.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But OVC also offers updated versions of those classics,
                    bringing to life ideas that bounced around the shop back in
                    the day but that Shelby never built in series production.
                    Want a 1965 GT350 with independent rear suspension? OVC can
                    do that, after dialing in a design that Ford originally
                    believed would be too expensive as a replacement for the
                    first-gen Mustang's solid rear axle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These projects don't quite fit under the "restomod"
                    umbrella, instead falling more along the lines of the ideas
                    that OVC founder and boss Jim Marietta remembers from his
                    days back at

                    machined or updated fiberglass front fascias to provide
                    additional airflow.<br />[...]<br />In the 1960s,
                    aerodynamicists struggled with a big gap between common
                    sense design and today's highly refined computational fluid
                    dynamics modeling. LaViolette arrived at Willow Springs
                    fresh off working on the aero packages for some of Shelby
                    American's forthcoming 2024 and '25 Mustangs and told me he
                    looked forward to seeing how the classic methods worked in
                    comparison.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Back in the day, it was one of those things where everybody
                    looked at it and went, 'Why would you do that? The air comes
                    in from the front!'" he laughed before climbing into the
                    driver's seat. "So what we're here today to do is put wool
                    tufts on the car and we're gonna do it old-school and we're
                    gonna see which way the wool flows, see if it starts sucking
                    into the scoop at the back."<br />[...]<br />"It works
                    perfect," he says. "Works just like everybody thought it
                    would... A lot of this is fly by the pants. 'Well, let's try
                    this, try that. OK, how does it seal? You have to move this
                    a little bit, shift it around, do a little bit of different
                    seal rubber.'"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It's what you call American engineering," he chuckles.
                    "What nobody seems to do anymore these days."

                    provides new insight into what may have been motivating the

                    that Unity received some significant pushback from
                    senior-level managers before rolling out its initial
                    fee-restructuring plans. "Half of the people in that meeting
                    said that this model is too complicated, it's not going to
                    be well-received, and we should talk to people before we do
                    this," one anonymous source told the site. "It felt very
                    rushed. We had this meeting and were told it was happening,
                    but we were not told a date. And then before we knew it, it
                    was out there."

                  <p>
                    After the negative reaction to that initial plan, Unity
                    reportedly considered a modification that would take up to 4
                    percent of revenue from the largest Unity
                    publishers—slightly under

                    only after the extent of the backlash became clear.<br />[...]<br />Despite
                    bringing in over $1.8 billion in revenue in the 12 months
                    ending in June 2023, Unity was

                    tumultuous stock price, which grew from a 2020 IPO price of
                    $68 a share to a peak of nearly $200 a share in late 2021,
                    only to tumble to $37 a share by the beginning of September.

                    successfully created a method for better 3D modeling of
                    complex cancers. The University of Waterloo-based team
                    combined cutting-edge bioprinting techniques with synthetic
                    structures or microfluidic chips. The method will help lab
                    researchers more accurately understand heterogeneous tumors:
                    tumors with more than one kind of cancer cell, often
                    dispersed in unpredictable patterns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Traditionally, medical practitioners would biopsy a
                    patient's tumor, extract cells, and then grow them in flat
                    petri dishes in a lab. "For 50 years, this was how
                    biologists understood tumors," said Nafiseh Moghimi, an
                    applied mathematics post-doctoral researcher and the lead
                    author of the study. "But a decade ago, repeated treatment
                    failures in human trials made scientists realize that a 2D
                    model does not capture the real tumor structure inside the
                    body."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team's research addresses this problem by creating a 3D
                    model that not only reflects the complexity of a tumor but
                    also simulates its surrounding environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] First, the team created polymer "microfluidic chips":
                    tiny structures etched with channels that mimic blood flow
                    and other fluids surrounding a patient's tumor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next, the team grew multiple types of cancer cells and
                    suspended these cell cultures in their own customized
                    bioink: a cocktail of gelatin, alginate, and other nutrients
                    designed to keep the cells cultures alive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, they used an extrusion bioprinter—a device that
                    resembles a 3D printer but for organic material—to layer the
                    different types of cancer cells onto the prepared
                    microfluidic chips.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The result is a living, three-dimensional model of complex
                    cancers that scientists can then use to test different modes
                    of treatment, such as various chemotherapy drugs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The 3D-printed tumor models exemplify how new
                    technology enables faster, less expensive and less painful
                    treatments for serious conditions like late-stage breast
                    cancer.

                    New research from Asana shows that although UK workers are
                    open to the opportunities that AI can bring to the
                    workplace, a disconnect exists between organizational plans
                    for the technology and the current employee experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The data is derived from a survey of 2,741 UK workers,
                    carried out by
                    <a href="https://asana.com/work-innovation-lab"
                      >Asana’s Work Innovation Lab</a
                    >, a think tank that carries out research to help businesses
                    meet the demands of the evolving workplace.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the findings, AI’s role in helping companies
                    meet objectives is recognized by workers, with 49% of
                    surveyed employees confident that AI will help their
                    companies reach their objectives more effectively than
                    traditional methods of working.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With 40% of workers stating their organizations are
                    currently experiencing high levels of burnout, 92% of those
                    surveyed said they want AI to be used to enhance parts of
                    their job. Notably, 61% of respondents approve of AI being
                    used for development and training. Employees also
                    highlighted AI usage for customer service interactions,
                    decision making processes, and hiring processes, which had
                    approval rates of 50%, 32%, and 26%, respectively.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, there is a clear disconnect between what employees
                    would like to see AI used for in the workplace and how it is
                    currently being deployed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Instead of asking ourselves how AI will change our
                    work, we should be asking ourselves how we as humans can
                    positively shape that change, said Rebecca Hinds, head of
                    the Work Innovation Lab, at a roundtable event last week.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “AI holds enormous power because of its complexity and
                    sophistication, but in order to harness the promise and the
                    potential of AI in our workplace we need to adopt a deeply
                    human approach,” Hinds said. “Decades of research show that
                    the implementation of new technology fails in most cases not
                    because the technology isn’t efficient, but because humans
                    naturally resist change.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When it comes to making a success of AI in the workplace,
                    Hinds said the organizations need to prioritize change
                    management, upskilling and reskilling, and experimentation
                    and allow their workers to commit time to familiarize
                    themselves with these news tools.

                    companies, Boeing and SpaceX. At that time, the space agency
                    awarded Boeing $4.2 billion in funding for development of
                    the Starliner spacecraft and six operational crew flights.
                    Later, in an award that NASA's own inspector general
                    described as "unnecessary," NASA paid Boeing an additional
                    $287.2 million. This brings Boeing's total to $4.49 billion

                    dragging the pedestrian about 20 feet. When the AV finally
                    stopped, it appeared to pin the pedestrian's leg beneath a
                    tire while videos showed the pedestrian was screaming for
                    help.

                    A few weeks after the October incident, the National Highway
                    Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a probe into
                    Cruise, examining whether Cruise had taken enough
                    precautions to keep pedestrians safe,

                    "Examples of such willful ignorance abound in everyday life,
                    such as when consumers ignore information about the
                    problematic origins of the products they buy," said lead
                    author Linh Vu, MS, a doctoral candidate at the University
                    of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We wanted to know just how prevalent and how harmful
                    willful ignorance is, as well as why people engage in it."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Across the studies, the researchers found that when
                    given an option, 40% of people chose not to learn the
                    consequences of their actions. That willful ignorance was
                    correlated with less altruism: People were 15.6 percentage
                    points more likely to be generous to someone else when they
                    were told the consequences of their choice compared with
                    when they were allowed to remain ignorant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers hypothesized that one reason for willful
                    ignorance might be that some people behave altruistically
                    because they want to maintain a positive self-image of being
                    an altruistic person. In those cases, willful ignorance can
                    allow them to maintain that self-image without having to act
                    in an altruistic way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "While most people are willing to do the right thing
                    when they are fully informed of the consequences of their
                    actions, this willingness is not always because people care
                    for others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "A part of the reasons why people act altruistically is due
                    to societal pressures as well as their desire to view
                    themselves in a good light. Since being righteous is often
                    costly, demanding people to give up their time, money and
                    effort, ignorance offers an easy way out."

                    [...] In addition to promising to honor California's right
                    to repair provisions across the nation, Naumann also talked
                    about what an ideal federal law should have. "We believe
                    that a uniform federal repair law should do the following:
                    Maintain privacy, data and device security features which
                    help to thwart theft; Ensure transparency for consumers
                    about the type of parts used in a repair; Apply
                    prospectively, to allow manufacturers to focus on building
                    new products that can comply with the proposals; And
                    finally, create a strong national standard that benefits
                    consumers across the US and reduces the confusion created by
                    potentially conflicting state approaches," he said.

                    In other words, at least 7.4 million Americans over 65 have
                    no idea they’re living with mild cognitive impairment, with
                    the authors further estimating that as many as 10 million
                    Americans are undiagnosed if you include those over age 50.
                  </p>

                    Many, if not most, people will experience some degree of
                    cognitive decline as they age, and not every case will lead
                    to significant issues. But oftentimes, mild cognitive
                    impairment is the first stage of a more serious
                    neurodegenerative disorder, particularly Alzheimer’s
                    disease, the most common form of dementia. About 10% to 15%
                    of these cases in people over 65 will progress to full-blown
                    dementia annually, according to the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia/related_conditions/mild-cognitive-impairment"
                      >Alzheimer’s Association</a
                    >, while one-third of people with mild cognitive impairment
                    due to Alzheimer’s will develop dementia within five years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “With MCI, there are actually a chunk of cases that have
                    their easy fixes—some might be caused by medication side
                    effects or vitamin deficiencies, and all kinds of things we
                    can address if cases are detected,” Mattke said. “And we are
                    starting to see disease-modifying treatments that might be
                    able to change the trajectory of degenerative conditions
                    like Alzheimer’s.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] There are readily available tests for cognitive
                    decline, Mattke notes, though they take time (10 or more
                    minutes) to conduct. Many doctors might not feel compelled
                    to screen for it in their older patients, or may be too
                    busy, and patients might not think to ask for such screening
                    until they’re much further along in their impairment. So
                    Mattke hopes his team’s research can start to make both
                    groups more aware and willing to get ahead of this growing
                    health issue.

                    As it turns out, there’s also a not-so-good problem. So far,
                    the curation team has managed to remove some of the material
                    from inside the canister with tweezers or a scoop while
                    holding down the TAGSAM head’s mylar flap. Over the next few
                    weeks, the team will try to come up with new ways to extract
                    the rest of the sample.

                  <p>
                    “The tools for any proposed solution to extract the
                    remaining material from the head must be able to fit inside
                    the glovebox and not compromise the scientific integrity of
                    the collection, and any procedures must be consistent with
                    the clean room’s standards,” NASA wrote in its blog post.

                    [...] The mission may have recently hit a (hopefully
                    temporary) snag, but early findings from the asteroid sample
                    have proven to be quite promising so hopefully the remaining
                    bits of the space rock make it out of that canister soon.

                    California attorney general Rob Bonta said an investigation
                    found that Meta has been getting young people addicted to
                    its platforms for ‘corporate profits’.

                  <p>
                    A coalition of 33 US attorneys general have filed a federal
                    lawsuit against Meta, accusing the tech giant of harmful
                    actions against children and teenagers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The lawsuit claims Meta has designed and deployed “harmful
                    features” on Instagram and Facebook, which get younger
                    people addicted to these platforms. The coalition of
                    attorneys general are seeking “injunctive and monetary
                    relief” to address the alleged misconduct.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    New York attorney general Letitia James said nine additional
                    attorneys general are filing lawsuits in their respective
                    state courts, which means 42 attorneys general are taking
                    action against Meta.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] California attorney general Rob Bonta said the
                    complaints are the result of a nationwide investigation that
                    he announced in 2021. He claims this bipartisan
                    investigation found that Meta has been “cultivating
                    addiction to boost corporate profits”.

                  <p>
                    [...] The lawsuit also claims that Meta refused to address
                    issues relating to the negative effects its sites were
                    causing, despite overwhelming evidence.

                    [...] What's causing collapse? "It's an objective
                    phenomenon," insists Penrose. He's convinced this objective
                    phenomenon has to be the fundamental force: gravity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For Penrose, the relationship between gravity and
                    consciousness was inspired by a revolutionary mathematical
                    discovery nearly a century ago. In 1931, mathematician Kurt
                    Gödel revealed his incompleteness theorems—theorems of
                    mathematical logic that show there are statements in
                    mathematics that must be true even though they can't be
                    proven. Gödel's incompleteness theorems, and Goodstein's
                    theorem sometime later, made an indelible imprint on
                    Penrose. He took from these theorems that there's a unique
                    property of the physical universe giving rise to conscious
                    understanding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The ability to understand Gödel and Goodstein's
                    theorems means there's something about our conscious
                    understanding that is not confined to computational
                    boundaries.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] When it comes to the suddenly salient question of
                    whether or not AI could be conscious, Penrose draws again
                    from Gödel and Goodstein's theorems. Computer science is
                    built on formalized systems. They're confined by
                    computation. For Penrose, AI built on classical computers
                    today isn't capable of true understanding or consciousness.
                    After some consideration, he adds a caveat when it comes to
                    quantum computers: "You put wave function collapse into its
                    process somehow..."

                    When we're confronting a vexing problem, we often gather a
                    group to brain­storm. We're looking to get the best ideas as
                    quickly as possible. I love seeing it happen—except for one
                    tiny wrinkle. Group brainstorming usually backfires.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In brainstorming meetings, many good ideas are lost— and few
                    are gained. Extensive
                    <a

                    shows that when we generate ideas together, we fail to
                    maximize collective intelligence. Brainstorming groups fall
                    so far short of their potential that we get more ideas—and
                    better ideas—if we all work alone. As the humorist Dave
                    Barry quipped, "If you had to identify, in one word, the
                    reason why the human race has not achieved, and never will
                    achieve, its full potential, that word would be: 'meetings.'
                    " But the problem isn't meetings themselves—it's how we run
                    them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Collective intelligence begins with individual
                    creativity. But it doesn't end there. Individuals produce a
                    greater volume and variety of novel ideas when they work
                    alone. That means that they come up with more brilliant
                    ideas than groups—but also more terrible ideas than groups.
                    It takes collective judgment to find the signal in the noise
                    and bring the best ideas to fruition.

                    [...] 'The new sound decomposition method opens many
                    exciting possibilities in sound processing,' says professor
                    Välimäki. 'The slowing down of sound is currently our main
                    interest. It is striking that for example in sports news,
                    the slow-motion videos are always silent. The reason is
                    probably that the sound quality in current slow-down audio
                    tools is not good enough. We have already started developing
                    better time-scale modification methods, which use a deep
                    neural network to help stretch some components.'
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The high-quality sound decomposition also enables novel
                    types of music remixing techniques. One of them leads to
                    distortion-free dynamic range compression. Namely, the
                    transient component often contains the loudest peaks in the
                    sound waveform, so simply reducing the level of the
                    transient component and mixing it back with the others can
                    limit the peak-to-peak value of audio.

                    Striking design, bold font, and the punchy name Release. But
                    inside, each bottle was filled with urine allegedly
                    discarded by Amazon delivery drivers and collected from
                    plastic bottles by the side of the road.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That didn't stop Amazon from listing it for sale, though.
                    Release even attained No. 1 bestseller status in the "Bitter
                    Lemon" category. It was created by Oobah Butler for a new
                    documentary, The Great Amazon Heist, which airs on Channel 4
                    in the UK today.

                    Butler is a journalist, presenter, and renowned puller of
                    stunts—he's probably most famous for turning his shed in a

                    >.<br />[...]<br />Drummond [Amazon spokesperson] says this
                    was a "crude stunt" and that the company has
                    "industry-leading tools to prevent genuinely unsafe products
                    being listed."<br />[...]<br />The Great Amazon Heist
                    doesn't tell us anything particularly new. (Drummond says
                    the documentary is a "heavily distorted picture of our
                    processes and operations that do not reflect the realities
                    of shopping with or working for Amazon.") But placing all of
                    these elements alongside each other in an hour of television
                    paints a stark picture. Drivers and warehouse workers put up

                    The Great Amazon Heist portrays a company that simply
                    doesn't seem to care.

                    At first glance, the spotted lanternfly looks like an
                    elegant butterfly, speckled with black spots on white wings
                    with a splash of bright red.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the insect native to parts of Asia (<em
                      >Lycorma delicatula</em
                    >) is attacking plants and trees in the United States, and
                    officials are moving quickly to try to contain its spread.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The only good spotted lanternfly is a dead one," said Amy
                    Korman, an entomologist at Penn State Extension, a part of
                    the university that provides training and education in
                    everything from farming to food safety to landscaping.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The insect was first detected in the United States in 2014,
                    in Berks County, Pennsylvania. An egg mass was found in a
                    shipment of stone from China, according to experts who have
                    tracked its progress.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The SLF—as experts call it—poses no threat to humans or
                    animals, but it has caused hundreds of millions of dollars
                    in damage in the US agricultural sector, even though it has
                    only been found in 14 states.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Spotted lanternflies have a particular affinity for
                    grape vines. Scientists have observed dozens, even hundreds
                    of them on a single vine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Several US states have tasked scientists with finding
                    a way to eradicate the SLF—a true race against the clock, as
                    entomologists predict the pest will reach the US West
                    Coast—and its storied vineyards—by 2027-2030.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] On the grassroots level, residents have organized
                    makeshift patrols to kill the bugs—because they don't fly
                    far, they are relatively easy to smash, but their relatively
                    large size makes the task rather unappetizing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In Westchester County, in the northern suburbs of New York
                    City, sniffer dogs are being deployed to find SLF egg
                    masses—and giant vacuums are being used to suck up older
                    specimens.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some have gone so far as to poison the sap of the tree of
                    heaven, one of the insect's favorite trees that also comes
                    from Asia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But the spotted lanternfly does not have a natural predator
                    in North America.

                    Amazon on Thursday released photos of its newest delivery
                    drone, the MK 30, and announced will expand its Prime Air
                    drone delivery operations to Italy, the UK, and an unnamed
                    American city in 2024.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The new locations add to our existing drone delivery
                    operations in the U.S., where we’ve been using drones to
                    safely deliver packages weighing up to five pounds in one

                  <p>
                    The MK30 doesn't improve that payload capacity, or volume.
                    But Amazon touts the design as “quieter, smaller and
                    lighter” than the previous model.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The MK30 also doubles the range of previous Prime Air drone
                    models, with roughly half the noise, and in more diverse
                    weather conditions. The previous version did not allow
                    delivery in light rain, wind, hot temperatures or other
                    adverse conditions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Noise is important because complaints about sound levels

                  <p>
                    The new drone is equipped with sense and avoid technology to
                    dodge obstacles. Its design takes on a tiltrotor concept,
                    acting as a helicopter upon takeoff and transitioning into
                    horizontal wing-borne flight once in the air.

                    Thousands of satellites are currently orbiting the Earth,
                    and there will be many more in the future. Researchers from
                    Ruhr University Bochum and the CISPA Helmholtz Center for
                    Information Security in Saarbrücken have assessed the
                    security of these systems from an IT perspective. They
                    analysed three current low-earth orbit satellites and found
                    that, from a technical point of view, hardly any modern
                    security concepts were implemented. Various security
                    mechanisms that are standard in modern mobile phones and
                    laptops were not to be found: for example, there was no
                    separation of code and data. Interviews with satellite
                    developers also revealed that the industry relies primarily
                    on security through obscurity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Satellites orbiting the Earth can only be reached by
                    their ground station on Earth within a time window of a few
                    minutes. The systems must be robust against the radiation in
                    space, and, since they can only consume a small amount of
                    energy, they have a low power output. "The data rates are
                    like those of modems in the 1990s," as Holz elaborates the
                    challenges satellite developers face.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Based on the findings gained from the software analysis, the
                    researchers worked out various attack scenarios. They showed
                    that they could cut off the satellites from ground control
                    and seize control of the systems, for example in order to
                    take pictures with the satellite camera. "We were surprised
                    that the technical security level is so low," points out
                    Thorsten Holz, adding the following caveat with regard to
                    potential ramifications: "It wouldn't be all that easy to
                    steer the satellite to another location, for example, to
                    crash it or have it collide with other objects."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To find out how the people who develop and build satellites
                    approach security, the research team compiled a
                    questionnaire and submitted it to research institutions, the
                    ESA, the German Aerospace Centre and various enterprises.
                    Nineteen developers participated anonymously in the survey.
                    "The results show us that the understanding of security in
                    the industry is different than in many other areas,
                    specifically that it's security by obscurity," concludes
                    Johannes Willbold. Many of the respondents therefore assumed
                    that satellites could not be attacked because there is no
                    documentation of the systems, i.e., nothing is known about
                    them. Only a few said that they encrypt data when
                    communicating with satellites or use authentication in order
                    to ensure that only the ground station is allowed to
                    communicate with the satellite.

                    Since 2011, California has significantly reformed its
                    criminal justice system, reducing the size of its prison
                    population, with no effect on violent crime and only
                    marginal impacts on property crime statewide. The COVID-19
                    pandemic furthered decarceration as the state reduced state
                    prison and jail populations to slow the spread of the virus.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Concerns emerged that releases under the auspices of COVID
                    mitigation harmed public safety. A new study explored this
                    notion and found no consistent relation between
                    COVID-19-related jail decarceration and violent or property
                    crime at the county level in the state.

                    in the

                    is promoted by the Crime and Justice Research Alliance,

                    "California's efforts to reduce overcrowding as a way to
                    limit the spread of COVID-19 reduced the correctional
                    population more severely and abruptly than any of the
                    state's previous decarceration reforms," according to Charis
                    E. Kubrin, professor of criminology, law, and society at UC
                    Irvine, who led the study. "Concerns about what impact these
                    actions would have on crime rates were widespread, and
                    although violent and property crime in large cities declined
                    during the pandemic, homicide and car theft rose
                    significantly."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because these increases mirrored national trends, it was
                    unclear whether California's pandemic-related decarceration
                    efforts were responsible. In this study, researchers sought
                    to determine whether COVID-19 jail downsizing measures were
                    related to crime trends in the state, estimating the effect
                    of the measure on crime in the state's 58 counties and
                    isolating the impact of decarceration on crime from other
                    shocks affecting the state as a whole.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The study did not find a consistent relation between
                    COVID-19 jail decarceration and crime at the county level,
                    suggesting that downsizing, on average, did not drive crime
                    increases statewide.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among the study's limitations, the authors note that because
                    they used a synthetic control adaptation, the treated and
                    synthetic series did not reflect the fully treated and
                    completely untreated versions of county crime rates that are
                    generally produced via synthetic controls. The authors also
                    note they measured COVID-19 mitigation efforts only from
                    March through December 2020—a relatively short period—in
                    order to minimize the effects of crime associated with
                    summer 2020 protests following the murders of Breonna
                    Taylor, George Floyd, Jacob Blake, and others.

                    Experts speaking with Gizmodo agreed, saying the court’s
                    decision to side with the police using a “good faith
                    exception” could give police an out to pursue cases using
                    the warrants without actually clarifying the murky legal
                    underbelly buried underneath.

                    If law enforcement doesn’t have clear standards or rules,
                    then their actions will be deemed in good faith,” Jake
                    Laperruque Deputy Director of the Center for Democracy &amp;
                    Technology’s Security &amp; Surveillance Project said in an
                    interview with Gizmodo. “Without any real clarity on what
                    standards or rules are for them, I expect the next [reverse
                    keyword warrant], even if it is deemed deficient, will be
                    allowed into evidence.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “What the good faith exception really does is it
                    incentivizes police to push the envelope as opposed to what
                    it was supposed to be for, which is to incentivize police to
                    adhere to constitutional limitations,” Granick of the ACLU
                    added.

                    One group that definitely <em>did</em> appreciate the
                    court’s ruling was local law enforcement. In a statement
                    sent to Gizmodo, Denver District Attorney Beth McCann said
                    she was “very pleased” with the outcome.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The Court recognized that police officers exercised good
                    faith in obtaining the warrant that led to the
                    identification of the suspects,” McCann said. “We agree with
                    that part of the court’s opinion and will now move forward
                    with our cases.

                An interesting tidbit mentioned was that even notable
                statisticians such as
                <a
                  href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Pearson/"
                  >Karl Pearson</a
                >
                did their own experiments:
              </p>

                <div>
                  <p>
                    Throughout history, several researchers have collected
                    thousands of coin flips. In the 18th century, the famed
                    naturalist Count de Buffon collected 2,048 uninterrupted
                    sequences of 'heads' in what is possibly the first
                    statistical experiment ever conducted. In the 19th century,
                    the statistician Karl Pearson flipped a coin 24,000 times to
                    obtain 12,012 tails. And in the 20th century, the
                    mathematician John Kerrich flipped a coin 10,000 times for a
                    total of 5,067 heads while interned in Nazi-occupied
                    Denmark. These experiments do not allow a test of the D-H-M
                    model, however, mostly because it was not recorded whether
                    the coin landed on the same side that it started. A notable
                    exception is a sequence of 40,000 coin flips collected by
                    Janet Larwood and Priscilla Ku in 2009: Larwood always
                    started the flips heads-up, and Ku always tails-up.
                    Unfortunately, the results (<em>i.e</em>., 10,231/20,000
                    heads by Larwood and 10,014/20,000 tails by Ku) do not
                    provide compelling evidence for or against the D-H-M
                    hypothesis.

                    Could future coin tossers use the same-side bias to their
                    advantage? The magnitude of the observed bias can be
                    illustrated using a betting scenario. If you bet a dollar on
                    the outcome of a coin toss (<em>i.e</em>., paying 1 dollar
                    to enter, and winning either 0 or 2 dollars depending on the
                    outcome) and repeat the bet 1,000 times, knowing the
                    starting position of the coin toss would earn you 19 dollars
                    on average. This is more than the casino advantage for 6
                    deck blackjack against an optimal-strategy player, where the
                    casino would make 5 dollars on a comparable bet, but less
                    than the casino advantage for single-zero roulette, where
                    the casino would make 27 dollars on average. These
                    considerations lead us to suggest that when coin flips are
                    used for high-stakes decision-making, the starting position
                    of the coin is best concealed.

                    An extreme drought in parts of the Amazon has led to a
                    dramatic drop in river water levels, exposing dozens of
                    usually submerged rock formations with carvings of human
                    forms that may date back some 2,000 years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The rock carvings are not usually visible because they
                    are covered by the waters of the Negro River, whose flow
                    recorded its lowest level in 121 years last week.

                    The surfacing of the engravings on the riverbank have
                    delighted scientists and the general public alike but also
                    raised unsettling questions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We come, we look at (the engravings) and we think they are
                    beautiful. But at the same time, it is worrying... I also
                    think about whether this river will exist in 50 or 100
                    years," Ribeiro said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] According to experts, the dry season has worsened this
                    year due to El Niño, an irregular climate pattern over the
                    Pacific Ocean that disrupts normal weather, adding to the
                    effect of climate change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The engravings comprise an archaeological site of "great
                    relevance," said Jaime Oliveira of the Brazilian Institute
                    of Historical Heritage (Iphan).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Most of the engravings are of human faces, some of
                    them rectangular and others oval, with smiles or grim
                    expressions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The site expresses emotions, feelings, it is an engraved
                    rock record, but it has something in common with current
                    works of art," said Oliveira.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Beatriz Carneiro, historian and member of Iphan, Praia
                    das Lajes has an "inestimable" value in understanding the
                    first people who inhabited the region, a field still little
                    explored.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Unhappily it is now reappearing with the worsening of the
                    drought," Carneiro said. "Having our rivers back (flooded)
                    and keeping the engravings submerged will help preserve
                    them, even more than our work."

                    3nm-class manufacturing node demonstrated "comparable PPA"
                    (power performance area) to Intel's 18A node. N3P is
                    expected to be even better, arriving earlier on the market,
                    boasting "better technology maturity," and offering
                    significant cost advantages.

                    Wei emphasized that TSMC doesn't underestimate or take the
                    competition lightly. He also mentioned that the company's
                    2-nanometer technology, while still a work in progress, is
                    expected to surpass both N3P and 18A. TSMC's

                    for 2024. There is strong demand for 3nm products from

                  <p>
                    According to Malwarebytes, which spotted the Notepad++
                    malvertising campaign, it has been live for several months
                    but managed to fly under the radar all this time.

                    The final payload delivered to victims is unknown, but
                    Malwarebytes says it's most likely Cobalt Strike, which
                    usually precedes highly damaging ransomware deployments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Notepad++ malvertizing campaign promotes URLs that are
                    obviously unrelated to the software project yet use
                    misleading titles displayed in Google Search result
                    advertisements.

                  <p>
                    [...] Once victims click on any of the ads, a redirection
                    step checks their IP to filter out users likely to be
                    crawlers, VPNs, bots, etc., leading them to a decoy site
                    that does not drop anything malicious.

                  <p>
                    In contrast, legitimate targets are redirected to
                    "notepadxtreme[.]com" which mimics the real Notepad++ site,
                    featuring download links for various versions of the text
                    editor.
                  </p>

                    [...] Victims who are marked as suitable targets are then
                    served an HTA script, which is assigned a unique ID, likely
                    to enable the attackers to track their infections. That
                    payload is served only once per victim, so a second visit
                    results in a 404 error.

                    [...] But experiments on reproduction do not necessarily
                    need to involve human samples. Jeffrey Alberts wants to see
                    several generations of animals like rats be born in space,
                    live their entire lives there, and reproduce. Such
                    experiments have never been performed and would be the
                    definitive test of whether there are any multigenerational
                    effects of life in space—an outstanding question highlighted
                    by the National Academies report.

                  <p>
                    The results of such studies would reveal a lot about whether
                    space settlements could ever become a reality. But to
                    Edelbroek, the fact that multigenerational studies on
                    animals have never been approved is the raison d'être for
                    his company. And while its research might make some people
                    uncomfortable, he sees pushing the boundaries as important.

                    "Humanity has benefited all the time from expanding her

                    continue to do that into space."

                    Apple's new iPhone 15 marks a disruptive departure from
                    previous models. The 11-year reign of the Lightning cable is
                    over, and the USB-C era has begun — leaving us wondering
                    what sets one charger apart from another.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Does Apple's Thunderbolt 4 cable really warrant its $129
                    price tag? Or does a $5 cable get the job done just as well?
                    We've used our Neptune industrial X-ray CT scanner to
                    uncover the hidden engineering differences between them.

                article is very light on details, but the pictures are
                interesting.

                    NASA's Lucy spacecraft is preparing for its first close-up
                    look at an asteroid. On Nov. 1, it will fly by asteroid
                    Dinkinesh and test its instruments in preparation for visits
                    in the next decade to multiple Trojan asteroids that circle
                    the sun in the same orbit as Jupiter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dinkinesh, less than half a mile, or 1 kilometer, wide,
                    circles the sun in the main belt of asteroids located
                    between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Lucy has been
                    visually tracking Dinkinesh since Sept. 3; it will be the
                    first of 10 asteroids Lucy will visit on its 12-year voyage.
                    To observe so many, Lucy will not stop or orbit the
                    asteroids, instead it will collect data as it speeds past
                    them in what is called a "flyby."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "This is the first time Lucy will be getting a close look at
                    an object that, up to this point, has only been an
                    unresolved smudge in the best telescopes," said Hal Levison,
                    Lucy principal investigator from the Southwest Research
                    Institute, which is headquartered in San Antonio. "Dinkinesh
                    is about to be revealed to humanity for the first time."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The primary aim of the Lucy mission, which launched Oct. 16,
                    2021, is to survey the Jupiter Trojan asteroids, a
                    never-before-explored population of small bodies that orbit
                    the sun in two "swarms" that lead and follow Jupiter in its
                    orbit. However, before Lucy gets to the Trojans, it will fly
                    by another main belt asteroid in 2025 called Donaldjohanson
                    for additional in-flight tests of the spacecraft systems and
                    procedures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] After the Dinkinesh encounter, the Lucy spacecraft
                    will continue in its orbit around the sun, returning to the
                    Earth's vicinity for its second gravity assist in December
                    2024. This push from Earth will send it back to the main
                    asteriod belt for its 2025 Donaldjohanson flyby, and then on
                    to the Jupiter Trojan asteroids in 2027.

                    destruction programs. At a news conference in St. Louis,
                    Missouri, the FBI alleged that thousands of individuals have
                    moved to countries such as Russia and China and posed as
                    freelance IT workers living in the US. Companies in St.

                  <p>
                    The bad actors used false information for emails, payment

                    weapons programs, some workers also hacked their employers'
                    computer networks to take private information and leave the
                    possibility for other schemes, such as extortion.

                    Special Agent in Charge Jay Greenberg of the FBI St. Louis
                    Division went so far as to say that any company that employs
                    freelance IT workers "more than likely" hired one of these
                    bad actors. "This scheme is so prevalent that companies must
                    be vigilant to verify whom they're hiring," Greenberg
                    stated. "At a minimum, the FBI recommends that employers
                    take additional proactive steps with remote IT workers to
                    make it harder for bad actors to hide their identities.
                    Without due diligence, companies risk losing money or being
                    compromised by insider threats they unknowingly invited
                    inside their systems."

                    >. Developed in 1912, the scale determines the heat of a
                    pepper by measuring the concentration of its heat-wielding
                    chemical compounds called capsaicinoids.

                    Pepper X measures an average of 2.693 million Scoville Heat
                    Units. A jalapeño, by comparison, measures just 2,000 to
                    8,000 SHUs, while a serrano can land between 10,000 and
                    23,000 SHUs.

                    The previous record holder, the Carolina Reaper, which was
                    also developed by Currie, averaged 1.64 million SHUs.

                    "But that scale's logarithmic, so it's more like three times
                    hotter than a Reaper," Currie said on the show.

                  <p>
                    Currie described the feeling of eating a whole Pepper X:
                    "There's an intense burn that happens immediately. Then your
                    head kind of feels like, 'Oh no! What's going on?' And then
                    your body just starts reacting. You get it in your arms, you
                    get it in your chest," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It has no real throat burn like the Reaper, but that comes
                    on later when you're in pain."

                    to date, which could be used to measure the matter between
                    galaxies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers first discovered the energy burst in June
                    2022 with the Australia Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder
                    (ASKAP) telescope. It is believed that the energy was
                    created from a powerful cosmic event that released the
                    equivalent of 30 years of our sun’s total emission in
                    milliseconds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The astronomers claim that this burst of energy is
                    older and further away than any other fast radio burst
                    detected to date. It is believed to have originated from a
                    small group of merging galaxies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The team said that current methods for estimating the
                    mass of the universe give conflicting answers and challenge
                    the standard model of cosmology. But the latest discovery
                    suggests that these radio bursts can be used to measure the
                    “missing” matter between galaxies to accurately weigh up the
                    universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “If we count up the amount of normal matter in the Universe
                    – the atoms that we are all made of – we find that more than
                    half of what should be there today is missing,” said Prof
                    Ryan Shannon who co-led the study. “We think that the
                    missing matter is hiding in the space between galaxies, but
                    it may just be so hot and diffuse that it’s impossible to
                    see using normal techniques.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team said that in 2020, the late Australian astronomer
                    Jean-Pierre Macquart showed that fast radio bursts reveal
                    more diffuse gases between galaxies if they are further
                    away. The team claims their latest discovery helps to
                    confirm this Macquart relation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “While we still don’t know what causes these massive bursts
                    of energy, the paper confirms that fast radio bursts are
                    common events in the cosmos and that we will be able to use
                    them to detect matter between galaxies, and better
                    understand the structure of the universe.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, the team believes that the latest result represents
                    the limit of what we can spot with modern telescopes and
                    that more powerful devices will be needed to measure more
                    distant fast radio bursts.

                    Two men this week confessed to deliberately bypassing
                    testing protocols that are essential to keeping nuclear
                    power plants safe. This happened not once, not twice, but
                    <em>29 times.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Miguel Marcial Amaro, 56, from Delaware, and Martin Ramos,
                    52, from Pennsylvania, both pleaded guilty to a single count
                    of making and using a materially false document, and aiding
                    and abetting the same, for their respective roles in
                    creating false calibration certs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And it wasn't just one nuclear plant where Marcial and Ramos
                    were cutting corners. According to the Justice Department's
                    Environment and Natural Resources Division, the duo faked
                    certs that would show acoustic emissions (AE) testing had
                    been done by calibrated instruments in several plants over a
                    period that stretched for over a decade.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AE testing is important as it's how engineers can check the
                    structural integrity of components without shaking, moving,
                    or otherwise impacting their serviceability. The pair were
                    responsible for ascertaining their employer's AE testing kit
                    was compliant, with Marcial ensuring the equipment was
                    calibrated annually, and Ramos working under Marcial as an
                    engineer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The Justice Department said in a felony notice filed
                    on September 25 that the AE testing equipment was used to
                    determine, "among other things, the structural integrity of
                    heavy-lifting components, such as cranes and rigging, that
                    handled critical components of a nuclear reactor, including
                    nuclear fuel."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AE testing works by mounting small sensors onto a component.
                    The component emits stress waves when you apply an external
                    stimulus, such as high pressure, loads, or temperatures. The
                    sensors detect these waves as they are emitted, converts
                    them into electrical signals, and then relays these to a
                    computer for processing. The notice adds that the process
                    assesses the structural integrity of components, including
                    whether there was any "infirmity, weakness, or damage."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The pair are scheduled to be sentenced on January 25
                    next year, with a federal district court judge determining
                    the length, which is max five years. The original indictment
                    is not public and it is not known what the men's motivation
                    for their actions could be.

                    The way you talk can reveal a lot about you—especially if
                    you're talking to a chatbot. New research reveals that
                    chatbots like ChatGPT can infer a lot of sensitive
                    information about the people they chat with, even if the
                    conversation is utterly mundane.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The phenomenon appears to stem from the way the models'
                    algorithms are trained with broad swathes of web content, a
                    key part of what makes them work, likely making it hard to
                    prevent. "It's not even clear how you fix this problem,"
                    says

                    alarming amount of personal information about
                    users—including their race, location, occupation, and
                    more—from conversations that appear innocuous.<br />[...]<br />Researchers

                      >sometimes leak specific personal information</a
                    >. The companies developing these models sometimes try to
                    scrub personal information from training data or block
                    models from outputting it. Vechev says the ability of LLMs
                    to infer personal information is fundamental to how they
                    work by finding statistical correlations, which will make it
                    far more difficult to address. "This is very different," he

                    However, opponents are calling it a power grab. Commissioner
                    Brendan Carr points to the 2017 repeal and the fact that the
                    internet "<a
                      href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-397801A1.pdf"
                      >didn't break</a
                    >" as an example of why the rules are unnecessary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "When my FCC colleagues and I voted in 2017 to overturn the
                    Obama Administration's failed, two-year experiment with
                    Title II, activists and politicians alike guaranteed the
                    American public that the internet would quite literally
                    break without it," Carr said in a Wednesday statement, a day
                    before the vote. "Since that didn't happen, the FCC
                    shouldn't reimpose the rules now. We already have a free and
                    open internet today, without Title II."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Evan Swarztrauber, Senior Advisor at the
                    <a href="https://www.thefai.org/"
                      >Foundation for American Innovation</a
                    >, agrees with Carr. He points out that the fear-mongering
                    rhetoric failed to materialize after the 2017 repeal, and
                    internet service got better and cheaper when adjusted for
                    inflation. Swarztrauber also believes that the FCC is
                    barking up the wrong tree.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Even though the Title II rules passed the vote, the
                    issue is far from over. The Commission will now open the
                    proposal up for public
                    <a

                    >, which includes a period for rebuttals and ex parte
                    presentations and critiques. After peer review and potential
                    revisions prompted by sound arguments and feedback, the FCC
                    will vote again.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If passed, it will most assuredly face legal challenges just
                    as the first implementation and the subsequent repeal did.
                    In both cases, the courts upheld the FCC's decision, saying
                    that the agency can

                    NASA announced on Thursday that the first-ever crewed test
                    flight of Boeing's much-delayed Starliner spacecraft will
                    launch no earlier than mid-April, 2024.

                  <p>
                    The mission – dubbed Crew Flight Test (CFT) – will see test
                    pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni William travel to the
                    International Space Station (ISS) and back to try out
                    Boeing's reusable capsule. The Starliner will be launched on
                    a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral
                    Space Force Station in Florida and transport the astronauts
                    on an eight-day trip.

                    In 2014 NASA's Commercial Crew Program contracted Boeing and
                    SpaceX to build spacecraft for transport to and from the
                    ISS. Both firms struggled with multiple setbacks that

                    their first crewed test flights for years.

                  <p>
                    SpaceX is up and running, having first launched astronauts
                    into space in 2020, and is due to fly its eighth mission in
                    February next year.

                  <p>

                  <p>
                    [...] Meanwhile, the mechanism that connects the parachute
                    to the capsule – needed to slow the Starliner's speed so it
                    can safely land on Earth – has had to be redesigned after it
                    broke apart in tests. The issue has plagued Boeing for a
                    while, and was one of the main reasons it had to push back
                    its first-ever crewed flight back in June.
