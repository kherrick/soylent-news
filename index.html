                    In a burnished-oak corridor outside the committee room at
                    IBM's headquarters in August 1980, two engineers pace
                    nervously. Eventually, a door opens. Their boss, Bill Lowe,
                    emerges from the board room next door. Before they can say
                    anything, he smiles and nods. They laugh. They can't quite
                    believe it. It's official. IBM is going to try and build a
                    home computer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bill Lowe kicked off this ambitious project, but he wouldn't
                    be the person who would finish it. That role would fall to
                    his successor, a humble, cowboy boot-wearing mid-level
                    executive, out of favor and kicking his heels in the IBM
                    corporate backwater of Boca Raton, Florida. He would take
                    Lowe's project forward, one nobody else in the company
                    wanted. Just 12 months later, on August 15, 1981, a computer
                    would launch that would change the world: the IBM PC.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is the story of Don Estridge, the man who brought the
                    IBM PC to market and changed business and home computing
                    forever. In just five years he created an IBM division that
                    almost nobody else in the company wanted to exist. By 1983,
                    it had seized 70 percent of the microcomputer market and was
                    valued at over $4 billion ($12 billion today). Under
                    Estridge, IBM's PC division sold over 1 million machines a
                    year, making it the third largest computer manufacturer in
                    the world on its own. This story is based on contemporary
                    accounts in publications such as InfoWorld, PC magazine,
                    Time, and the New York Times, as well as books such as Blue
                    Magic by James Chposky and Ted Leonsis; Big Blues by Paul
                    Carroll; and Fire in the Valley by Michael Swaine and Paul
                    Frieberger.

                    A study carried out by the University of Helsinki's DogRisk
                    research group, the University of Eastern Finland and Wise
                    Nose – Scent Discrimination Association in Finland
                    investigated the threshold for scent detection in dogs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study revealed that dogs can learn to identify
                    concentrations of eucalyptus hydrolate that are clearly
                    below the detection threshold of sophisticated analytical
                    instruments used today. The concentrations were also far
                    below previously reported levels. Dogs' extraordinary sense
                    of smell can be exploited, for example, in search and rescue
                    operations and in medical detection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 15 dogs that participated in the study had different
                    training backgrounds. Some dogs had experience of nose work,
                    which is a hobby and competitive dog sport, while some had
                    been trained to identify diseases, mould or pests.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the study, the dogs were to differentiate samples
                    containing low concentrations of eucalyptus hydrolate from
                    samples containing only water. The focus was on determining
                    the lowest concentration that the dogs could detect for
                    certain. The study included three different tests where the
                    concentrations of the hydrolate were diluted gradually until
                    the dogs could no longer identify the scent. This determined
                    the threshold for their scent detection ability.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "The dogs' scent detection threshold initially varied from
                    1:10⁴–1:10²³ but narrowed down to 1:10¹⁷–1:10²¹ after a
                    training period. In other words, the dogs needed 1 to 10
                    molecules per millilitre of water to detect the right
                    sample. For perspective, a single yeast cell contains 42
                    million molecules," describes the principal investigator of
                    the study, Anna Hielm-Björkman from the University of
                    Helsinki.

                    The indigenous Marubo people, who for hundreds of years have
                    existed in small huts along the Itui River in the Amazon,
                    were connected to the billionaire's satellite network in
                    September.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The community embraced the technology, marvelling at the
                    life-saving ability to call for immediate help when
                    grappling with venomous snake bites as well as being able to
                    remain in contact with faraway relatives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But, since a group of men arrived at the camp with antennas
                    strapped to their backs to connect the remote tribe of 2,000
                    people to the internet, there have been some less desirable
                    consequences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Critics warn tribe members have become "lazy", reclining in
                    hammocks all day glued to their phones to gossip on WhatsApp
                    or chat to strangers on Instagram.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And there have already been reports of young men engaging in
                    aggressive sexual behaviour after being exposed to
                    pornography, Alfredo Marubo, leader of a Marubo association
                    of villages, told The New York Times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Young men brought up in a culture where kissing in public is
                    seen as scandalous have been sharing explicit videos with
                    one another in group chats, he said, adding: "We're worried
                    young people are going to want to try it."<br />...<br />Kâipa
                    Marubo, a father of three, said he was concerned about his
                    children playing first-person shooter video games, fearing
                    they might want to mimic the attacks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another leader, Enoque Marubo, 40, said the tribe has
                    started limiting the hours members could access the internet
                    because its introduction had "changed the routine so much
                    that it was detrimental".
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Members can browse the internet for two hours in the morning
                    and five hours in the afternoon and all day on Sundays.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "In the village, if you don't hunt, fish and plant, you
                    don't eat," Enoque said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Enoque worked with Brazilian activist Flora Dutra to bring
                    the internet to the tribe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They contacted American philanthropist Allyson Reneau, who
                    reportedly donated 20 Starlink units to the Marubo tribe.

                Given how fast they learn, it shouldn't take long to figure out
                that content creation could be more lucrative than just
                consumption. Does Amazon deliver WebCams and lights in the

                  <p>
                    The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission
                    have reached a deal that clears the way for potential
                    antitrust investigations into the dominant roles that
                    Microsoft (MSFT.O), OpenAI and Nvidia (NVDA.O) , play in the
                    artificial intelligence industry, according to a source
                    familiar with the matter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The agreement between the two agencies shows regulatory
                    scrutiny is gathering steam amid concerns over concentration
                    in the industries that make up AI. Microsoft and Nvidia not
                    only dominate their industries but are also the world's two
                    biggest companies by market capitalization.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The move to divvy up the industry mirrors a similar
                    agreement between the two agencies in 2019 to divide
                    enforcement against Big Tech, which ultimately saw the FTC
                    bring cases against Meta (META.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O), and
                    the DOJ sue Apple (AAPL.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) for alleged
                    violations. Those cases are ongoing and the companies have
                    denied wrongdoing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While OpenAI's parent is a nonprofit, Microsoft has invested
                    $13 billion in a for-profit subsidiary, for what would be a
                    49% stake.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Justice Department will take the lead in investigating
                    whether Nvidia violated antitrust laws, while the FTC will
                    examine the conduct of OpenAI and Microsoft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The regulators struck the deal over the past week, and it is
                    expected to be completed in the coming days, the person
                    said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nvidia has roughly 80% of the AI chip market, including the
                    custom AI processors made by the cloud computing companies
                    like Google, Microsoft and Amazon.com. That domination helps
                    the company report gross margins between 70% and 80%.

                    microbiologists and paleontologists in the Czech Republic
                    and the University of Minnesota, in the U.S., has found

                    Environmental scientists have long suggested that temporary

                    other types of plants survive during the last ice age, but

                    the area during the last ice age, as the weight of glaciers
                    sliding down the nearby Alps set off tectonic activity,
                    releasing geothermally heated water from deep within the
                    Earth's crust.

                  <p>
                    The release of warm water, the researchers reasoned, would
                    have formed an oasis, keeping the ground around the hot
                    springs warm enough for trees and other plants to survive
                    even though they would have been surrounded by ice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During their search, the research team found bits of wood,
                    pollen and fossilized bits of leaves from trees that should
                    not have been able to survive in the area during the last
                    ice—yet, they were dated to between 19,000 and 26,000 years
                    ago, a span of time that correlated to the last ice age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The findings strongly support the presence of an oasis
                    during the last ice age—one that helped some types of trees
                    survive despite the cold.

                Shuffling a set means randomly choosing an ordered sequence of
                its elements.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, shuffling {A,B,C} means choosing with equal
                probability one of 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 permutations: ABC, ACB,
                BAC, BCA, CAB, or CBA.

                    When you think about games written for the Atari Video
                    Computer System (or 2600) today, what do you picture? Likely
                    a home version of an arcade game, or some kind of shooter, a
                    maze game, something that takes place entirely on a single
                    screen. This is not the entirety of the 2600 library, though
                    – major releases such as
                    <i>Pitfall!, Adventure, E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial</i>, or
                    <i>Smurfs: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle</i> were built around
                    worlds that extended beyond the screen's borders, where you
                    didn't necessarily know what was coming next or how you'd
                    need to approach that challenge. And among the most
                    ambitious of these titles announced was <i>Tarzan</i>, to be
                    published by Coleco for the 2600 and the ColecoVision
                    console in 1984.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <i>Tarzan</i> was initially announced for as a 1983
                    ColecoVision release at the 1983 Winter Consumer Electronics
                    Show, held in Las Vegas, with a 2600 port announced later
                    that year during the summer CES for a November release.
                    These dates slipped, with the ColecoVision
                    <i>Tarzan</i> finally shipping in August, and the 2600 game
                    announced as a second quarter release before being quietly
                    canceled. The released ColecoVision version was fairly
                    well-reviewed, with the newsletter
                    <i>Computer Entertainer</i> praising the graphics and the
                    varied action, noting strategy is required to clear the
                    game. But the 2600 version faded into obscurity, considered
                    just another project canceled due to the 1983 North American
                    market collapse and its yearslong aftermath. In 2011 a
                    manual for the game turned up, but the game itself remained
                    lost. Lost, that is, until collector Rob "AtariSpot" managed
                    to purchase a working copy of the game off of a former
                    Coleco employee in 2022 and successfully worked with
                    longtime Atari homebrew programmer Thomas Jentzsch to get it
                    dumped. All 2600 games bigger than 4 kilobytes in size
                    utilize an approach called "bankswitching" to get around
                    hardware limitations by inserting code that gets the console
                    to look at a separate 4-kilobyte chunk of data. This allowed
                    for larger and more complex game programs, and
                    <i>Tarzan</i>, a 12-kilobyte cartridge, is no exception. The
                    game uses a unique bankswitching scheme, but Jentzsch was
                    able to modify it into a standard "F6" bankswitch to make it
                    operable on emulators and flash carts. Both versions are

                            northwestern France, on June 6 to mark the 80th
                            anniversary of the 1944 D-Day landings, when more
                            than 150,000 Allied soldiers invaded France to drive
                            out the forces of Nazi Germany.

                            Eighty years later, Normandy's beaches and fields
                            still bear the scars of the fighting that erupted on
                            D-Day, history's largest amphibious invasion.

                    Adult content has always proliferated on Twitter, but the
                    platform now called X recently clarified its
                    <a
                      href="https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/adult-content"

                    to officially allow "consensually produced and distributed
                    adult nudity or sexual behavior."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    X's rules seem simple. As long as content is "properly
                    labeled and not prominently displayed," users can share
                    material—including AI-generated or animated content—"that is
                    pornographic or intended to cause sexual arousal."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We believe that users should be able to create, distribute,
                    and consume material related to sexual themes as long as it
                    is consensually produced and distributed," X's policy said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The policy update seemingly reflects X's core mission to
                    defend all legal speech. It protects a wide range of sexual
                    expression, including depictions of explicit or implicit
                    sexual behavior, simulated sexual intercourse, full or
                    partial nudity, and close-ups of genitals, buttocks, or
                    breasts.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    [....] now requires content warnings so that "users who do

                  <p>
                    FreeBSD 14.1-RELEASE is now available for the amd64, i386,
                    powerpc, powerpc64, powerpc64le, powerpcspe, armv7, aarch64,

                  </p>
                  <p>Some of the highlights:</p>
                  <p>
                      - The C library now has SIMD implementations of string and
                    memory operations on amd64 for improved performance.<br />
                      - Improvements to the sound subsystem, including device
                    hotplug.<br />
                      - Initial native cloud-init (configuration drive) support
                    compatible with OpenStack and many hosters.<br />
                      - OpenZFS has been upgraded to version 2.2.4.<br />
                      - Clang/LLVM have been upgraded to version 18.1.5.<br />
                      - OpenSSH has been upgraded to version 9.7p1.

                Personally, I generally prefer to compile from source, so most
                of my installations are on a <b>-STABLE</b> branch.

                I suppose though, it might be a good time to

                    The social media platform currently allows people to swipe
                    or scroll past adverts that appear in its main feed of
                    images and videos, as well as in its Stories and Reels
                    feeds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But it is now trialling a feature called "ad break", which
                    users say they can not flick past as usual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Images shared online show a timer, which counts down to zero
                    before normal functionality can resume.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Sometimes you may need to view an ad before you can keep
                    browsing," the Meta-owned platform tells those who click for
                    more information.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instagram has confirmed to the BBC that a trial is under
                    way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We're always testing formats that can drive value for
                    advertisers," it said in a statement, adding that it would
                    provide further updates if the test resulted in permanent
                    format changes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It remains to be seen if the trial pleases advertisers - but
                    it certainly does not appear to have gone down well with
                    users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Meta is not the first big tech firm to force people to
                    watch adverts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    YouTube is known for showing non-skippable ads to users
                    watching videos on its platform or TV app who do not pay for
                    its ad-free premium tier.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Some users have responded by turning to ad blocking
                    tools and browser extensions as a way around adverts that
                    interrupt videos on the platform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google, YouTube's parent company, is in turn trying to clamp
                    down on ad blockers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However it is not clear that forcing users to watch more ads
                    actually helps companies' bottom lines.

                    Cerebrovascular accidents, or strokes, are the most common
                    cause of aphasia, a speech disorder of cerebral origin.
                    People with aphasia have a reduced ability to understand or
                    produce speech or written language. An estimated 40% of
                    people who have had a stroke have aphasia. As many as half
                    of them experience aphasia symptoms even a year after the
                    original attack.

                    >
                    that sung music helps in the language recovery of patients
                    affected by strokes. Now, the researchers have uncovered the
                    reason for the rehabilitative effect of singing. The
                    recently completed study was published in the eNeuro
                    journal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the findings, singing, as it were, repairs the
                    structural language network of the brain. The language
                    network processes language and speech in our brain. In
                    patients with aphasia, the network has been damaged.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "For the first time, our findings demonstrate that the
                    rehabilitation of patients with aphasia through singing is
                    based on neuroplasticity changes, that is, the plasticity of
                    the brain," says University Researcher

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The language network encompasses the cortical regions of the
                    brain involved in the processing of language and speech, as
                    well as the white matter tracts that convey information
                    between the different end points of the cortex.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to the study results, singing increased the volume
                    of grey matter in the language regions of the left frontal
                    lobe and improved tract connectivity especially in the
                    language network of the left hemisphere, but also in the
                    right hemisphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "These positive changes were associated with patients'
                    improved speech production," Sihvonen says.

                    These new chips sport the new centralized architecture from
                    AMD, namely Zen 5, on the CPU end. The chipmaker claimed Zen
                    5 is a big update
                    <a
                      href="https://gizmodo.com/amd-zen-4-ryzen-7000-chips-release-date-price-specs-1849470723"
                      >compared to Zen 4</a
                    >, which is supposed to handle twice the bandwidth of the
                    last generation. What does this mean for PCs? AMD promises
                    you’ll see up to 19% better benchmark performance in
                    Geekbench 6 or 13% better in 3DMark’s physics tests, but
                    that will depend on your PC’s exact chip and other
                    architecture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Zen 5 is different from the XDNA 2 NPU architecture. You can
                    break up the TOPS speed in the NPU into a whole bunch of
                    other categories, but AMD claims XDNA 2 is two times as
                    power efficient and many times the total neural computing
                    capacity of the previous gen’s 10 or 16 TOPS.

                    For those who could not care less about the productivity
                    machines centering on the AI 300 chips, all you want to know
                    is how the Ryzen 9000 series stacks up compared to the last
                    generation and Intel’s latest. That includes the Ryzen 5
                    9600X, Ryzen 7 9700X, Ryzen 9 9900X, and at the tippy top
                    end is the Ryzen 9 9950X. Most boast slightly higher clock
                    speeds, but several, like the 9900x and 9700X, are far more
                    power efficient with better TDP.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To pick on the big boy, that 9950X has 16 cores, 32 threads,
                    and up to 5.7 GHz clock speeds. That’s technically the same
                    specs as the Ryzen 9 7950X3D from the last gen. AMD is
                    trying to hit Intel’s Core i9-14900K by claiming you’ll see
                    marginally better framerates in games like
                    <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> or <em>F1 2023</em> and far better
                    bandwidth for multitasking thanks to the new Zen 5
                    architecture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All those gaming-centric CPUs should be arriving in July
                    this year. There’s good news for anybody with the
                    motherboard supporting the AM5 socket. AMD promises to
                    support AM5 through 2027, so if you’re considering
                    upgrading, you’ll have a chance in the next few years. After
                    over eight years of running, AMD plans to end support for
                    AM4 sometime in or after 2025. Zen 5 will continue to be
                    specific to AM5.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The chipmaker said pricing is not set for the series 9000
                    chips, but we should know more closer to release in July.

                    "By placing a smooth metal surface between the radar and a
                    target vehicle with a specific orientation, the transmitted
                    mmWave signals can be deflected from the radar receiver,
                    leading to a reduction in the energy of echo signals from
                    the vehicle," wrote the study authors. "When the energy
                    becomes lower than a threshold, the target vehicle will be
                    hidden from radar perception."

                    Meanwhile, the color patch misrepresented input image pixel
                    values and affected Apollo's camera perception. Reflections
                    confused its read on Lidar lasers. Thus all three sensing
                    modalities were compromised.

                    The [researchers] suggest that the attack could be carried
                    out with drones, which serve to "hide" a secondary vehicle
                    from the victim AV by projecting or carrying the adversarial
                    object. Absent a drone, the trickster collage could be
                    mounted on the front vehicle and disguised as an
                    advertisement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Since the drones only hover for a few seconds during the
                    attack and can fly away from the victim AV immediately after
                    the attack, the attack can be performed with high
                    stealthiness and flexibility," noted the researchers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Baidu Apollo platforms were used in the attack, the
                    attack strategy could theoretically be applied to other
                    multi-sensor fusion systems.

                    It was not created to fuel AI applications, but ERA5 has
                    turned out to be incredibly useful for this purpose.
                    Computer scientists only really got serious about using this
                    data to train AI models to forecast the weather in 2022.
                    Since then, the technology has made rapid strides. In some
                    cases, the output of these models is already superior to
                    global weather models that scientists have labored decades
                    to design and build, and they require some of the most
                    powerful supercomputers in the world to run.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "It is clear that machine learning is a significant part of
                    the future of weather forecasting," said Matthew Chantry,
                    who leads AI forecasting efforts at the European weather
                    center known as ECMWF, in an interview with Ars.

                    John Dean and Kai Marshland met as undergraduates at
                    Stanford University in the late 2010s. Dean, an electrical
                    engineer, interned at SpaceX during the summer of 2017.
                    Marshland, a computer scientist, interned at the launch
                    company the next summer. Both graduated in 2019 and were
                    trying to figure out what to do with their lives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "We decided we wanted to solve the problem of weather
                    uncertainty," Marshland said, so they co-founded a company
                    called WindBorne Systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Dean and Marshland set about designing small weather
                    balloons they could release into the atmosphere and which
                    would fly around the world for up to 40 days, relaying
                    useful atmospheric data that could be packaged and sold to
                    large, government-funded weather models.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Weather balloons provide invaluable data about atmospheric
                    conditions—readings such as temperature, dewpoints, and
                    pressures—that cannot be captured by surface observations or
                    satellites. Such atmospheric "profiles" are helpful in
                    setting the initial conditions models start with. Such
                    atmospheric "profiles" are helpful in setting the initial
                    conditions models start with. The problem is that
                    traditional weather balloons are cumbersome and only operate
                    for a few hours. Because of this, the National Weather
                    Service only launches them twice daily from about 100
                    locations [weather.gov] in the United States.

                    An international research team has now found it's not just
                    in fiction. In a study involving 111 kids aged between 3 and
                    6 years old, the youngsters showed a preference for
                    believing robots more and being more accepting when robots
                    made mistakes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] The kids were split up into different groups and
                    shown videos of robots and humans labeling objects – some
                    objects the children would already recognize, as well as new
                    objects they wouldn't know the names of.

                  <p>
                    Human and robot reliability was demonstrated by giving
                    familiar objects incorrect name, calling a plate a spoon for
                    example. In this way the researchers could manipulate the
                    children's sense of who to trust.

                    favor robots when asked about who they would share secrets
                    with, who they would want to be friends with, and who they

                    selected as doing things on purpose, but not an unreliable

                    The study provides support for agri-environmental measures
                    (AEM)—environmentally friendly agricultural practices such
                    as using flowering plants in field margins. AEM can be an
                    effective way to increase farmland biodiversity and mitigate
                    the negative impact of land consolidation. They have been
                    widely implemented in Europe but are hardly used in China.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Dr. Jenny Hodgson, a co-author from the University of
                    Liverpool, says, "This study is noteworthy because of the
                    quality of its data and the breadth of influential factors
                    we were able to investigate. It has been really interesting
                    to disentangle the effects of farmland consolidation, of
                    pesticide application and of seminatural habitat beyond the
                    farm."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The team also acknowledges that biodiversity is not a
                    farmer's only concern.

                  <p>
                    Dr. Shanxing Gong, who graduated from XJTLU, now a
                    postdoctoral researcher at Peking University and lead author
                    of the study, says, "The trade-off between biodiversity
                    improvements with labor efficiency, yield and pest control
                    is a balance that has to be finely tuned to ensure maximum
                    profitability, and these factors will always need to be
                    considered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "While we did not observe a direct correlation between the
                    increase in the number of rice pests and the reduction of
                    their natural enemies due to land consolidation, further
                    investigation into the effectiveness of natural enemies in
                    biological pest control is necessary before implementing AEM
                    strategies."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The researchers also found no decrease in rice yield in
                    traditional fields compared to consolidated farmland.

                The plight, in this case, is that Indonesia's Administration, in
                the name of public accessibility and user friendliness, has
                created an estimated 27,000 apps for hapless Indonesians to
                "navigate" their (supposedly public) services. One department --
                probably the smallest -- has created 500 of the gleaming
                critters. It is only a guess how many of these are only
                (somewhat) accessible through smart phones, require a crap ton
                of captchas to solve, an electronic identity card, a special
                reader for that electronic identity card, a scan of your birth
                certificate, a digital signature on that scan, details of your
                last family status including the full and spelling correct names
                of all family members to the third degree separation, and the
                colour of your underwear, and all that just to enter and be

                    you almost think it has to have an airborne factor."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On March 7, Turley called the Texas Animal Health
                    Commission. They convened a One Health group with experts in
                    animal health, human health, and agriculture to ponder what
                    they called the "mystery syndrome." State veterinarians
                    probed cow tissue for parasites, examined the animals'
                    blood, and tested for viruses and bacteria. But nothing
                    explained the sickness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They didn't probe for H5N1. While it has jumped into mammals
                    dozens of times, it rarely has spread between species. Most
                    cases have been in carnivores, which likely ate infected
                    birds. Cows are mainly vegetarian.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "If someone told me about a milk drop in cows, I wouldn't
                    think to test for H5N1 because, no, cattle don't get that,"
                    said Thomas Peacock, a virologist at the Pirbright Institute
                    of England who studies avian influenza.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Postmortem tests of grackles, blackbirds, and other birds
                    found dead on dairy farms detected H5N1, but that didn't
                    turn the tide. "We didn't think much of it since we have
                    seen H5N1-positive birds everywhere in the country," said
                    Amy Swinford, director of the Texas A&amp;M Veterinary
                    Medical Diagnostic Laboratory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the meantime, rumors swirled about a rash of illness
                    among workers at dairy farms in the panhandle. It was flu
                    season, however, and hospitals weren't reporting anything
                    out of the ordinary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bethany Boggess Alcauter, director of research at the
                    National Center for Farmworker Health, has worked in the
                    panhandle and suspected farmworkers were unlikely to see a
                    doctor even if they needed one. Clinics are far from where
                    they live, she said, and many don't speak English or
                    Spanish—for instance, they may speak Indigenous languages
                    such as Mixtec, which is common in parts of Mexico.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The cost of medical care is another deterrent, along with
                    losing pay by missing work—or losing their jobs—if they
                    don't show up. "Even when medical care is there," she said,
                    "it's a challenge."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What finally tipped off veterinarians? A few farm cats died
                    suddenly and tested positive for H5N1. Swinford's
                    group—collaborating with veterinary labs at Iowa State and
                    Cornell universities—searched for the virus in samples drawn
                    from sick cows.

                    The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given Amazon
                    permission to fly its delivery drones beyond visual line of
                    sight (BVLOS). With that hurdle cleared, the company claims
                    it can fly farther and expand drone service, providing
                    customers faster delivery and a larger selection of items,
                    Amazon

                    in a blog post.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Until now, the FAA has only allowed Amazon to fly drones as
                    far as someone could see them from the ground. That way,
                    spotters or pilots could ensure that drones weren't
                    interfering with aircraft. However, the constraint seriously
                    limited how far the drones could travel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To move beyond that, Amazon said it spent years developing
                    "onboard detect-and-avoid technology." It submitted
                    engineering information to the FAA including operation,
                    maintenance and performance details. Flight tests were then
                    conducted in the presence of FAA inspectors around
                    airplanes, helicopters and a hot air balloon to "demonstrate
                    how the drone safely navigated away from each one of them,"
                    Amazon said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With BVLOS approval in hand, the company plans to expand its
                    delivery area around its drone facility at College Station,
                    Texas. Later in 2024, drone deliveries will be integrated
                    into its broader delivery network.

                    At the same time, traits detrimental to the everyday lives
                    of pet dogs may be valuable to working dogs or dogs used in
                    dog sports. For example, impulsiveness can be useful in dog
                    sports or work-related tasks where fast reactions and
                    excitability can be assets, while independence (as opposed
                    to reliance on humans) may be a valuable trait in scent
                    work.

                    The results will help to better identify the kinds of traits
                    in dogs that facilitate everyday life with them, improving
                    the welfare of both owner and dog. "In an earlier study, we
                    observed differences between breeds and sex in different
                    test sections, and these results can together help in
                    choosing a suitable individual puppy," Tiira says.

                    owners in which a connection to the dog's trainability and
                    also to the rate of learning has been observed. Thanks to
                    the smartDOG test already being available, Finnish dog
                    owners can directly make use of the research findings. This
                    research dataset of more than 6,000 dogs is continuously
                    growing, and next we will investigate how early these traits
                    can be seen in puppies, as well as their heritability,"

                    OpenAI has revealed operations linked to Russia, China, Iran
                    and Israel have been using its artificial intelligence tools
                    to create and spread disinformation, as technology becomes a
                    powerful weapon in information warfare in an election-heavy

                    The San Francisco-based maker of the ChatGPT chatbot said in
                    a report on Thursday that five covert influence operations
                    had used its AI models to generate text and images at a high
                    volume, with fewer language errors than previously, as well
                    as to generate comments or replies to their own posts.
                    OpenAI's policies prohibit the use of its models to deceive
                    or mislead others.

                    uncovering such disinformation campaigns and was building
                    its own AI-powered tools to make detection and analysis
                    "more effective." It added its safety systems already made
                    it difficult for the perpetrators to operate, with its
                    models refusing in multiple instances to generate the text

                  <p>
                    Kaspersky has released a new virus removal tool named KVRT
                    for the Linux platform, allowing users to scan their systems
                    and remove malware and other known threats for free.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The security firm notes that despite the common
                    misconception that Linux systems are intrinsically secure
                    from threats, there has been a constant supply of "in the
                    wild" examples that prove otherwise, most recently, the XZ
                    Utils backdoor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kaspersky's new tool isn't a real-time threat protection
                    tool but a standalone scanner that can detect malware,
                    adware, legitimate programs abused for malicious purposes,
                    and other known threats and offers to clean them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "Our application can scan system memory, startup
                    objects, boot sectors, and all files in the operating system
                    for known malware. It scans files of all formats — including
                    archived ones," says Kaspersky.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One thing to note is that KVRT only supports 64-bit systems
                    and requires an active internet connection to work.

                    Stargazers are in with a chance of a celestial treat on
                    Monday with six planets appearing in alignment.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    and Uranus will take part in the parade – which occurs when
                    planets gather on the same side of the sun.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Prof Danny Steeghs, of the University of Warwick said the
                    event, which should be visible around the world, was due to
                    occur around sunrise and would be rather low in the east,
                    meaning the alignment would need some equipment to see
                    properly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Uranus and Neptune will be faint, so viewers will require
                    good binoculars to see them," he said, adding that the
                    proximity of
                    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/jupiter"

                    >
                    and Mercury to the sun would restrict their view.

                    The animals are the first transgenic echinoderms, the phylum
                    that includes starfish, sea cucumbers and other marine
                    animals. Hamdoun's mission is to make genetically modified
                    urchins available to researchers anywhere, not just those
                    who happen to work in research facilities at the edge of the
                    Pacific Ocean.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The lab's breakthrough, and its focus on making the
                    animals freely available to fellow scientists, will "allow
                    us to explore how evolution has solved a lot of really
                    complicated life problems," he said.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researchers tend to study mice, flies and the like not
                    because the animals' biology is best suited to answer their
                    questions but because "all the tools that were necessary to
                    get at your questions were built up in just a few species,"
                    said Deirdre Lyons, an associate professor of biology at
                    Scripps who worked with Hamdoun on early research related to
                    the project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Expanding the range of animals available for sophisticated
                    lab work is like adding colors to an artist's palette, Lyons
                    said, "Now you can go get the color that you really want,
                    that best fits your vision, rather than being stuck with a
                    few models."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Hamdoun vividly recalls the time he spent earlier in
                    his career trying to track down random snippets of DNA
                    necessary for his research, the disappointment and
                    frustration of writing to professors and former postdocs
                    only to find that the material had long been lost. He'd
                    rather future generations of scientists spend their time on
                    discovery.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "Biology is really interesting," he said. "The more people
                    can get access to it, the more we're going to learn."

                    from Sony's internal Game &amp; Network Services business
                    reports, the PS5 has raked in $106 billion in sales since
                    launching in November 2020. That's quite the figure for a
                    console that's 'only' been on the market for around three
                    and a half years.

                    However, several aspects require clarification. That $106
                    billion doesn't just account for PS5 hardware and software
                    sales – it covers Sony's entire gaming business during the
                    current generation: PS4 sales, older game releases,
                    subscriptions, the works. It's the total pie, not just the
                    PS5 slice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, the numbers are impressive when you consider the PS4
                    generation 'only' pulled in $107 billion across its entire
                    seven-year run from 2013 to 2019. With the PS5 closing in on
                    that total revenue after just four years, it's clearly on
                    track to become Sony's biggest console cash cow ever.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The secret sauce seems to be players spending more cash on
                    the PS5 ecosystem as a whole. While the PS4 outsold its
                    successor by a massive 117 million to 56 million units, the
                    higher PS5 price tag combined with increased spending on
                    DLC, microtransactions, services, and accessories is giving
                    Sony a bigger bang for its buck.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    [...] While the researchers have analyzed attacks on home
                    and small office routers before, they said two things make
                    this latest one stand out. They explained:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, this campaign resulted in a hardware-based
                    replacement of the affected devices, which likely indicates
                    that the attacker corrupted the firmware on specific models.
                    The event was unprecedented due to the number of units
                    affected—no attack that we can recall has required the
                    replacement of over 600,000 devices. In addition, this type
                    of attack has only ever happened once before, with AcidRain
                    used as a precursor to an active military invasion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The second unique aspect is that this campaign was confined
                    to a particular ASN. Most previous campaigns we’ve seen
                    target a specific router model or common vulnerability and
                    have effects across multiple providers’ networks. In this
                    instance, we observed that both Sagemcom and ActionTec
                    devices were impacted at the same time, both within the same
                    provider’s network.This led us to assess it was not the
                    result of a faulty firmware update by a single manufacturer,
                    which would normally be confined to one device model or
                    models from a given company. Our analysis of the Censys data
                    shows the impact was only for the two in question. This
                    combination of factors led us to conclude the event was
                    likely a deliberate action taken by an unattributed
                    malicious cyber actor, even if we were not able to recover
                    the destructive module.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With no clear idea how the routers came to be infected, the
                    researchers can only offer the usual generic advice for
                    keeping such devices free of malware. That includes
                    installing security updates, replacing default passwords
                    with strong ones, and regular rebooting. ISPs and other
                    organizations that manage routers should follow additional
                    advice for securing the management interfaces for
                    administering the devices.

                    the US CHIPS Act when he decided to grow his manufacturing
                    site in the American South. That gamble has now paid off

                    Thursday it is awarding $75 million from the CHIPS Act
                    subsidy pool to SKC subsidiary Absolics to support the
                    construction of additional facilities in Covington, Georgia.
                    Those facilities will be focused on the development and
                    production of glass semiconductor substrates.

                  <p>
                    According to the department, it's the first CHIPS Act
                    investment in a commercial facility to manufacture new
                    advanced materials for the semiconductor industry – that
                    material being glass substrates. The $53 billion CHIPS
                    funding pool was created by the White House and Congress to
                    boost the development and manufacturing of semiconductors on
                    US soil to help the country wean itself off foreign
                    suppliers.

                    Gina Raimondo. "The advanced semiconductor packaging

                    Absolics' parent is a subsidiary of the South Korean
                    mega-chaebol SK Group, which includes among its other
                    subsidiaries chip giant SK hynix. Having an in-house maker
                    of cutting-edge substrates makes perfect sense given the SK
                    umbrella.

                    an expansion of the company's decades-old Covington plant
                    for glass semiconductor work. SK pledged it would spend $240
                    million on a 120,000-square-foot Absolics facility to
                    manufacture glass substrates, which Park predicted "will be
                    the key material in the high-performance computing industry"
                    in the coming years. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2022 Park said glass substrates made in the US would
                    largely be shipped to Asia for semiconductor manufacturing,
                    with some surely ending up at SK hynix. The reason for
                    making them in America, he said, was because US semi
                    manufacturing was booming [...] and a local glass substrate
                    plant would be well-positioned to benefit from demand for
                    the material.

                    Now the biz has applied for and bagged $75 million in direct

                  <p>The Making of Donkey Kong for the Atari 2600</p>
                  <p>
                    In the summer of 1982, I spent about three months creating a
                    list of 4,096 numbers, meticulously ensuring that every
                    single number was the right value, and in the correct place
                    in the list. When I finished, the only tangible evidence of
                    my work was that long list of numbers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the list was complete, after nearly 1,000 hours of
                    work, the former Connecticut Leather Company¹ put the
                    numbers (in order) into a computer memory chip and plastic
                    case and sold it at stores throughout the country. And
                    people actually bought it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The list of numbers that I created was known to the public
                    as the Atari 2600 version of the hit coin-op video game
                    Donkey Kong. To create the list, I wrote a computer program
                    in 6502 assembly language in about 3 months, with little
                    sleep. With enormous pressure to submit final code in time
                    for holiday sales, I finished the game with a push of 72
                    straight hours at my desk, after which I was told that I
                    looked like a zombie.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] For background, Nintendo's Donkey Kong (the arcade
                    game) was a breakthrough in video game design, and one of
                    the most successful coin-operated games of the early 1980's.
                    To be clear, I did not invent Donkey Kong. The game was
                    designed by the legendary Shigeru Miyamoto, who has gone on
                    to be possibly the most successful video game designer in
                    history. It was the first video game to feature Mario, who
                    went on to fame and fortune in the Super Mario Bros series
                    of games (though in Donkey Kong he was referred to only as
                    Jumpman). Donkey Kong was one of the first video games to
                    use cartoon-quality animation and storytelling to draw the
                    player into the action. My role was limited to creating an
                    Atari 2600 version of Miyamoto's masterpiece.

                    Noise-canceling headphones have gotten very good at creating
                    an auditory blank slate. But allowing certain sounds from a
                    wearer's environment through the erasure still challenges
                    researchers. The latest edition of Apple's AirPods Pro, for
                    instance,

                    for wearers — sensing when they're in conversation, for
                    instance — but the user has little control over whom to
                    listen to or when this happens.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A University of Washington team has developed an artificial
                    intelligence system that lets a user wearing headphones look
                    at a person speaking for three to five seconds to "enroll"
                    them. The system, called "Target Speech Hearing," then
                    cancels all other sounds in the environment and plays just
                    the enrolled speaker's voice in real time even as the
                    listener moves around in noisy places and no longer faces
                    the speaker.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [....] To use the system, a person wearing off-the-shelf
                    headphones fitted with microphones taps a button while
                    directing their head at someone talking. The sound waves
                    from that speaker's voice then should reach the microphones
                    on both sides of the headset simultaneously; there's a
                    16-degree margin of error. The headphones send that signal
                    to an on-board embedded
                    <a
                      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer"

                    >
                    where the team's machine learning software learns the
                    desired speaker's vocal patterns. The system latches onto
                    that speaker's voice and continues to play it back to the
                    listener, even as the pair moves around. The system's
                    ability to focus on the enrolled voice improves as the
                    speaker keeps talking,
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Currently the TSH system can enroll[sic] only one
                    speaker at a time, and it's only able to enroll [sic] a
                    speaker when there is not another loud voice coming from the
                    same direction as the target speaker's voice. If a user
                    isn't happy with the sound quality, they can run another
                    enrollment on the speaker to improve the clarity.

                It would seem the embedded single board computer would get very
                good at only allowing the voice of a speaker who talks too much.

                        During the initial deployment of a Google Cloud VMware
                        Engine (GCVE) Private Cloud for the customer using an
                        internal tool, there was an inadvertent misconfiguration
                        of the GCVE service by Google operators due to leaving a
                        parameter blank. This had the unintended and then
                        unknown consequence of defaulting the customer's GCVE
                        Private Cloud to a fixed term, with automatic deletion
                        at the end of that period. The incident trigger and the
                        downstream system behavior have both been corrected to
                        ensure that this cannot happen again.

                    [...] In its post-mortem, Google now says, "Data backups
                    that were stored in Google Cloud Storage in the same region
                    were not impacted by the deletion, and, along with third
                    party backup software, were instrumental in aiding the rapid
                    restoration." It's hard to square these two statements,
                    especially with the two-week recovery period. The goal of a
                    backup is to be quickly restored; so either UniSuper's
                    backups didn't get deleted and weren't effective, leading to
                    two weeks of downtime, or they would have been effective had
                    they not been partially or completely wiped out.

                    [...] Google says Cloud still has "safeguards in place with
                    a combination of soft delete, advance notification, and
                    human-in-the-loop, as appropriate," and it confirmed these
                    safeguards all still work.

              <p>This one screams for a movie adaptation, but fast.</p>
              <p>
                In February this year, Hong Kong police announced that a major
                firm had been victim of a successful impersonation attack.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now the Financial Times has revealed the firm involved was Arup
                engineering -- builder of, among others, the Sydney Opera
                Building, the
                <a href="https://thegherkin.com/building/">Gherkin</a> in
                central London, Guangzhou Opera House, and
                <a href="https://www.arup.com/services/design/projects"
                  >others</a
                >.

                  >What happened</a
                >
                was that an employee in the finance department was invited for a
                video conference with the CFO and other 'senior officers'.
                During that video conference, this employee was given the order
                to funnel a total of $25 million (US) to 5 local bank accounts
                through 15 transactions, which the employee duly did. After what
                were quite possibly a couple of sleepless nights, she decided to
                check with her higher-ups, which (one presumes) resulted in a
                few heart arrythmias.
              </p>
              <p>
                Turns out that everybody else on that video conference call was
                a digital fake.
              </p>
              <p>
                The current working hypothesis is that the scammer(s) used past
                online conferences to train AI to digitally recreate a scenario
                where the CFO ordered money transfers. So that adds public video
                postings as an additional headache to CIOs, CFOs and just about
                anyone who has decision power over rather large amounts of
                money. As if

              </p>
              <p>
                Now, remember: this is news because it hit a big company. But
                let your <i>schadenfreude</i> not stand in the way of a bitter
                realisation: the inescapable economic trend is that what was
                once reserved for the rich, will be made accessible for the
                ordinary people too.

                In a few years time, we'll be looking back with tender nostalgia
                to those Nigerian princes and their eternal banking problems.

                    The microbes that live in your gut are having their moment
                    in the sun. Even if you haven't been following the research,
                    you can't have missed the hundreds of adverts for probiotics
                    and prebiotics, aimed at selling you products to keep your
                    microbiome healthy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other microbiomes have also recently been discovered, and
                    these too play an important role in your health. Your mouth,
                    nasal cavity, skin and scalp all have their own unique
                    microbiomes. Some have even proposed that the brain has its
                    own microbiome.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The idea that the brain has a microbiome was first suggested
                    in 2013, but it didn't get much attention. This is mostly
                    due to the longstanding belief that the brain is a sterile
                    organ, shielded from the rest of the body and from harmful
                    agents that are circulating in our blood.<br />...<br />In
                    healthy brains, the so-called "blood-brain barrier" shields
                    the brain from the blood and any harmful substances
                    dissolved in it. However, during ageing and in neurological
                    diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, this protective
                    barrier becomes leaky and blood and harmful substances can
                    enter the brain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] A group of researchers from the University of
                    Edinburgh compared the brains of people with Alzheimer's
                    disease to healthy brains. The brains of people with
                    Alzheimer's harboured more bacteria and fungi than healthy
                    people. But they did find several species of fungi, bacteria
                    and other microorganisms in healthy brains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The human brain microbiome was found to be a subset (about
                    20%) of the gut microbiome. Although more bacteria were
                    found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's, the
                    researchers were not able to find a pattern of certain
                    bacteria that were only found in diseased brains. However,
                    this study has yet to be peer-reviewed and published in a
                    scientific journal, so the results should be treated with
                    some caution.

                    Change history: Google apparently keeps a copy of every
                    version of every page it has ever indexed. Meaning, Google
                    can "remember" every change ever made to a page. However,
                    Google only uses the last 20 changes of a URL when analyzing
                    links.

                Three years ago, Subaru, Mazda, Toyota, Kawasaki, and Yamaha
                announced a joint development scheme for combustion engines
                based on alternatives to conventional fossil fuels i.e.
                synthetic fuels, biofuels and liquid hydrogen. Last Monday, May
                28, Toyota, Subaru and Mazda unveiled the first results of that
                cooperation, a set of new ICE engines to go into production from
                2026.
              </p>
              <p>From the press blurb:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    With the next generation of engines, the three companies
                    will seek to not only improve standalone engine performance
                    but also optimize their integration with electric drive
                    units, harnessing the advantages of each.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While being highly efficient and powerful, the new engines
                    will also revolutionize vehicle packaging by being more
                    compact than existing models. Smaller engines will allow for
                    even lower hoods, improving design possibilities and
                    aerodynamic performance while contributing to better fuel
                    efficiency. The development will also emphasize compliance
                    with increasingly strict emissions regulations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the same time, the new engines will be made carbon
                    neutral by shifting away from fossil fuels and offering
                    compatibility with various alternatives, including e-fuel
                    (synthetic fuel), biofuels, and liquid hydrogen. In doing
                    so, these engines will contribute to the broader adoption of
                    CN fuels.

                    and GeForce RTX 4090 graphics cards. For extra measure,
                    Gigabyte has implemented what the brand calls the "PCIe UD
                    Slot X" in some of its high-end Intel and AMD motherboards.

                    [...] While the PCIe UD Slot X feature isn't novel, this is
                    the first time we've been given a specific metric of the
                    maximum weight it can withstand. One trend we've seen is
                    that graphics cards are becoming larger and more
                    power-hungry. The transition from the

                    (Blackwell) likely won't be any slimmer, 128 pounds is
                    overkill.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moreover, the initial PCB cracking was caused by the design
                    of the cutout, which didn't mitigate the weight of the
                    graphics card. So, while Gigabyte's PCIe UD Slot X supports
                    up to 128 pounds, it still won't impede PCB cracking because
                    the problem lies in the graphics card and not the expansion
                    slot. There weren't any reports of the expansion slot
                    breaking. It was always about the graphics card's warping or
                    the PCB cracking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Perhaps the 128 pounds refers to impact load, which would
                    make sense. A more sturdy expansion slot will help with
                    shipping and transportation, especially in the case of
                    pre-built machines. But then again, if the fall is high
                    enough, it won't matter if the expansion slot can
                    accommodate up to 500 pounds because the graphics card would
                    probably break. In a situation like this, many would prefer
                    that the expansion slot come off the motherboard rather than
                    fracturing the graphics card, which, in most cases, is the
                    more expensive hardware.

                    sodium, trans fat, saturated fat, and calories in
                    products—were rolled out in 2020. A handful of the lawsuits

                    have gained new insight on galaxies forming during an
                    earlier period of the universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These three galaxies are believed to be actively forming
                    when the universe was only 400m to 600m years old – compared
                    to the universe’s current estimated age of roughly 13.7bn
                    years. Thanks to Webb’s powerful instruments, researchers
                    can peer into this early period and learn more about how the
                    universe was formed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Webb’s data on this early period shows these three galaxies
                    are surrounded by gases. The researchers suspect these gases
                    are almost purely hydrogen and helium, the earliest elements
                    to exist in the cosmos.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] “We’re moving away from a picture of galaxies as
                    isolated ecosystems,” Nielsen said. “At this stage in the
                    history of the universe, galaxies are all intimately
                    connected to the intergalactic medium with its filaments and
                    structures of pristine gas.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] By combining spectra with Webb images, the team found
                    that the light from these three forming galaxies is being
                    absorbed by large amounts of neutral hydrogen gas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “The gas must be very widespread and cover a very large
                    fraction of the galaxy,” said study co-author and associate
                    professor Darach Watson. “This suggests that we are seeing
                    the assembly of neutral hydrogen gas into galaxies. That gas
                    will go on to cool, clump, and form new stars.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By matching James Webb’s data to existing models of star
                    formation, the researchers also found that these galaxies
                    primarily have populations of young stars, suggesting these
                    galaxies have not had enough time to form most of their
                    stars yet.

                    Nvidia's argument likely depends on the court agreeing that
                    AI models ingesting published works in order to transform
                    those works into weights governing AI outputs is fair use.

                    Some companies, like OpenAI, have already started licensing

                    license content from News Corp. "supports the contention"
                    that "publishers should be paid when their work is used for

                    Until this question is settled by courts or lawmakers,
                    companies training AI on the Books3 dataset will likely
                    continue to face lawsuits from rights holders, particularly
                    from those who see AI models as an extension of harms caused
                    by these allegedly illegal shadow libraries. A lawyer for

                    illegal."

                  <p>
                    Authors suing Nvidia have taken the next step, linking the
                    chipmaker to shadow libraries by arguing that "these shadow
                    libraries have long been of interest to the AI-training
                    community because they host and distribute vast quantities
                    of unlicensed copyrighted material. For that reason, these
                    shadow libraries also violate the US Copyright Act."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Nvidia apparently prepares to defend against copyright
                    suits by disputing what a shadow library even is, the
                    websites at the heart of Nvidia's suits may take less issue
                    with the label. Anna, the pseudonymous creator of Anna's
                    Archive, freely uses the term,
                    <a href="https://annas-blog.org/">describing</a> the site as
                    "the world's largest shadow library" while offering to train
                    other so-called pirate archivists.

                    However, also in 2023, the finally active Digital Markets
                    Unit (DMU) did get going with a Digital Markets, Competition
                    and Consumers Bill. While its stated purpose is to lead to
                    establishing codes of conduct for Big Tech firms, it's a
                    step toward emulating the existing Digital Markets Act in

                    until this week. On May 22, 2024, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak
                    called for a General Election, and that immediately changed
                    proceedings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] Bills cannot be carried over from one Parliament to
                    another, so the UK has been picking which it will rush
                    through, and which it will abandon. Consequently, on May 23,
                    Parliament debated and passed the bill.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] "We believe overall that this is a good Bill that
                    takes the first steps to regulating the behaviour of the big
                    tech companies, which is long overdue," said Baroness Jones
                    of Whitchurch (Labour).

                    Four zebrafish are alive and well after nearly a month in
                    space aboard China's Tiangong space station. As part of an
                    experiment testing the development of vertebrates in
                    microgravity, the fish live and swim within a small habitat
                    aboard the station.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the zebrafish have thus far survived, they are showing
                    some signs of disorientation. The taikonauts aboard
                    Tiangong—Ye Guangfu, Li Cong, and Li Guangsu—have reported
                    instances of swimming upside down, backward, and in circular
                    motions, suggesting that microgravity is having an effect on
                    their spatial awareness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The zebrafish were launched aboard Shenzhou-18, which
                    carried them, as well as a batch of hornwort, to orbit on
                    April 25, 2024. The aim of the project is to create a
                    self-sustaining ecosystem, studying the effects of both
                    microgravity and radiation on the development and growth of
                    these species.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The zebrafish genome has been fully sequenced, and for
                    these reasons zebrafish are commonly used in scientific
                    experiments on Earth. Seeing how these well-studied
                    creatures behave in such an extreme environment may have a
                    lot to tell us about the life and development of vertebrates
                    across species while exposed to microgravity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] This is not the first time fish have been to space.
                    Starting in 2012, a Japanese research project brought medaka
                    and zebrafish to the International Space Station for study
                    in a similar aquatic habitat. The results of those studies
                    revealed a decrease in bone density in the fish within just
                    ten days. Human astronauts experience similar effects in
                    orbit, though not on such quick time scales, and they can be
                    mitigated somewhat through rigorous exercise routines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    [...] The health and sustainability of animal life in space
                    is a key area of research for human spaceflight efforts. If
                    humans are to travel on long-term space missions, like those
                    required to reach Mars, then understanding the biological
                    implications of space travel is vital. These zebrafish are
                    the latest in a long line of experiments undertaken in this
                    pressing area of research.

                    But one of these Russian satellites, Kosmos 2542, released a
                    smaller sub-satellite, designated Kosmos 2543, which made
                    its own passes near the USA 245 spacecraft, a KH-11 imaging
                    satellite similar to USA 314. At one point, satellite
                    trackers noticed USA 245 made a slight change to orbit. Its
                    Russian pursuer later made a similar orbit adjustment to
                    keep up.

                    In 2020, Kosmos 2543 backed off from USA 245. Once well away
                    from the NRO satellite, Kosmos 2543 ejected a mysterious
                    projectile into space at a speed fast enough to damage any
                    target in its sights.

                    velocity of some 400 mph (700 km per hour), according to
                    McDowell's analysis of publicly available satellite tracking

                    looked at it as a very benign environment, where you didn't
                    have to worry about conflicts in space. As a matter of fact,
                    naming space as a warfighting domain was kind of forbidden,

                    The dent got his attention the most. He ran his finger
                    across this damaged area to see if it was indeed a dent or
                    perhaps some kind of residue. As he was rubbing the damaged
                    area of the panel, he felt a sudden sharp pain and jerked
                    his hand away. Due to the angle of his arm, he apparently
                    slit his wrist open on the extremely sharp corner where the
                    side panels and the tailgate meet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Initially, he thought this was just a superficial cut. So
                    did the Tesla employees who joked, "This thing can be
                    dangerous!" Then they noticed the blood pooling on the
                    ground below him. The service team rushed to get a first aid
                    kit, with which they disinfected and bandaged his wound.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Despite this rather disastrous delivery, bdesign did
                    finalize the paperwork and take the truck home. But by the
                    end of the day, his wound still hadn't begun to close. So he
                    spent the evening in the emergency room.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unfortunately, 'bdesign' isn't the first owner to get a gash
                    from the Cybertruck. Earlier this month, another owner

                      >cut themselves on the door's edge</a
                    > when exiting the vehicle. Of course, this type of door
                    injury is not unheard of. For instance, a

                    to them on more than one occasion. A Rivian owner injured
                    themselves in a similar manner,
                    <a

                    So this is not a one-off occurrence. Hopefully, it will not
                    become more common as more trucks hit the streets, and we
                    hope 'bdesign' has an easier time with his truck from now
                    on.

                    Silica glass, known for its brittleness, weight, and
                    non-biodegradable nature, faces challenges in finding
                    suitable alternatives.

                    Transparent wood, made by infusing polymers into wood, shows
                    promise but is hindered by limited availability of wood in
                    China and fire risks associated with its use. This study
                    explores the potential of utilizing bamboo, which has a
                    shorter growth cycle, as a valuable resource for developing
                    flame-retardant, smoke-suppressing, and superhydrophobic
                    transparent bamboo. A 3-layered flame-retardant barrier,
                    composed of a top silane layer, an intermediate layer of
                    SiO2 formed through hydrolysis-condensation of Na2SiO3 on
                    the surface, and an inner layer of Na2SiO3, has been
                    confirmed to be effective in reducing heat release, slowing
                    flame spread, and inhibiting the release of combustible
                    volatiles, toxic smoke, and CO.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Compared to natural bamboo and other congeneric transparent
                    products, the transparent bamboo displays remarkable
                    superiority, with the majority of parameters being notably
                    lower by an entire order of magnitude.

                    It achieves a long ignition time of 116 s, low total heat
                    release (0.7 MJ/m2), low total smoke production (0.063 m2),
                    and low peak CO concentration (0.008 kg/kg). Moreover, when
                    used as a substrate for perovskite solar cells, the
                    transparent bamboo displays the potential to act as a light
                    management layer, leading to a marked efficiency enhancement
                    of 15.29%. The excellent features of transparent bamboo make
                    it an enticing choice for future advancements in
                    flame-retardant glasses and optical devices.

                    Bamboo, often referred to as "the second forest", boasts a
                    rapid growth and regeneration rate, allowing it to reach
                    maturity and be utilized as a building material within 4 to
                    7 years of growth. With an output 4 times higher than wood
                    per acre, bamboo is recognized for its exceptional
                    efficiency. In terms of chemical composition, bamboo shares
                    similarities with wood, mainly consisting of lignin,
                    cellulose, and hemicellulose. Furthermore, the internal
                    hierarchical structure of bamboo closely resembles that of
                    wood, featuring high porosity and permeability because of
                    neatly arranged vertical channels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This characteristic suggests the potential use of bamboo in
                    the production of transparent composite materials.
                    Transparent bamboo offers 3 distinct advantages over
                    traditional silica glass. Firstly, the abundant and
                    renewable nature of bamboo feedstock aligns with
                    environmental sustainability goals. Secondly, transparent
                    bamboo exhibits high light transmittance and haze, enabling
                    privacy while facilitating the entry of natural light
                    indoors. Lastly, the low density and excellent ability to
                    regulate temperature and humidity from a bamboo template
                    further position it as a promising alternative to
                    conventional glass.
